<div class='poem'>
<p>In introducing these yarns let me state that now
I am laid up on the shelf my thoughts go back to
those days and nights of the veld and bush, and
I frequently feel I would give all the rest of the
map if I could again find myself on the open lands
of the frontier with a good horse between my knees
and a few score of the old boys behind me. Now
I hold pen instead of carbine and revolver, but why
should memories of the old days pass away? Let
me fancy I sit by the camp fire again, telling yarns
as we used to under the dark blue skies and
blazing stars of South Africa.</p>

<p>Let me spin you some yarns of the Lost Legion.</p>

<small>THE MAORI AS I KNEW HIM</small></h2>


<p>Camped in a London flat, sick of the turmoil, rows
and worries of the big city, with its pushing,
hurrying and ill-mannered crowds, can it be
wondered at that I let my thoughts often wander
far away to the days of my early manhood, when
I passed over ten years in the dense and silent,
though beautiful, bush of New Zealand, or rode
across the wild, open and breezy plains of its
inland plateaus? During this time I had ample
opportunities for observing and studying the
natives, both in war and peace: in the former
especially, as I not only fought against them, but
I also fought side by side with the brothers,
cousins and quondam friends of the very men we
were engaged against.</p>

<p>Queer, very queer, people they were, and, to
describe them in a few words, I should pronounce
them to be bundles of contradictions, whose faults
made them hateful, but whose many good qualities
rendered them one of the most charming race of
people it has ever been my lot to meet. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
have been described by numerous writers far more
capable than myself, and whose pens are far more
graphic than my own, but yet perhaps a few traits
in their many-sided characters, that I have experienced
myself, may interest you.</p>

<p>To begin with, let me speak of their courage,
which was displayed in such a marked degree
during the long wars that lasted from 1860 to 1871,
for the whole of which period the Maoris were
hopelessly outnumbered and, as far as armament
went, were equally outclassed. Yet these brave
fellows fought on and on, and even when the end
came, and the shattered remnants of the so-called
rebels took refuge in the King Country, the New
Zealand Government, fearing to risk further war
with the powerful Waikato tribes, resorted to what
was called the blanket-and-sugar policy, rather than
follow Te Kooti or demand his extradition from
King Tawhiao, who at that time was just as independent
of English rule as France was.</p>

<p>The first fighting took place in 1860, and soon
General Sir Duncan Cameron had over 1000
Imperial troops under his command, as well as
an equal number of Colonial Militia and Irregulars,
and also a powerful Naval Brigade. He had also
a strong force of Artillery, and was well supplied
with ammunition and stores of all kinds. Yet
perhaps you will scarcely credit me when I tell you
that never at any single moment had he more than
2000 natives in arms against him, and that he was
never opposed in any single action by even 1000 men.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that Sir Duncan&rsquo;s
force was one of the most powerful that England,
up to that time, without the assistance of allies,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
had ever put into the field; that the men who composed
it were all of them good, seasoned men, many
of them being veterans of the Crimea and Mutiny;
that the Militia were highly trained, most of them
old soldiers, under the command of ex-Imperial
officers; that the Irregulars proved themselves to
be second to none in the field, and that the natives
only possessed old muskets and fowling-pieces.</p>

<p>Now these numbers are staggering, but absolutely
correct, as it is also that the above force made but
small headway against this handful of savages;
for although Sir Duncan forced his way into the
Waikato and held a chain of forts there, yet on the
west coast, especially in the districts of Taranaki
and Wanganui, the settlers had to abandon their
homesteads, the women and children being sent
for safety to the South Island, and no man&rsquo;s life
was safe beyond rifle range of the forts. This was
the state of New Zealand in 1866, after six years
of incessant war, and it can only be accounted
for in the following way:&mdash;</p>

<p>To commence, the General and his officers were
hidebound with the old traditions and maxims
of the British army. They simply would not or
could not adapt themselves to the exigencies or
tactics of irregular warfare, nor could they be made
to understand or believe that a regiment that could
march in line like a brick wall might easily be
worsted by a mob of savages in a New Zealand
bush. Then again when attacking pahs: the
General considered that the correct way to do so
was, after a sharp bombardment, to rush the place
with the bayonet.</p>

<p>Who could imagine for a moment that natives<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
could hold their flimsy stockades against men
who had stormed the Redan and taken Delhi
at the point of the bayonet. Yet they did.
Rangiriri was assaulted three times, and on each
occasion, notwithstanding the splendid devotion
and courage of our gallant Tommies, they were
driven back with great loss. Yet on the following
day the 180 defenders marched out and laid down
their arms. Why? For three days they had been
without one drop of water. The General knew
they had no water, then why did he risk the lives
of his splendid men by ordering futile assaults?
Rangiriri took place in November 1863, and one
would have thought that the General might have
learned something, by its lesson, of the ways how
best to deal with a Maori pah; but he had neglected
to do so, for in April, the following year, he invested
Orakau Pah, the defenders of which exhibited
gallantry seldom equalled and never surpassed in
all the annals of human warfare. Let me try and
give you a brief account, as I heard it some years
afterwards from the mouth of one of its defenders:</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Listen, Te Parione, I will tell you how I
first saw white men and fought against them.
It was at Orakau, in the land of the Waikato tribes,
and the fight happened in this manner:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We of the Taupo tribes must pay a visit of
ceremony to the chiefs and people of the Waikatos,
and at the same time the Uriwera people wished
to do the same. Our intention was to discuss
many things with the Waikatos, and to hold a big
runanga (deliberation) concerning the war. We
journeyed there, although we knew much war was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
going on, and we were most anxious to hear about
and see something of this war, so that we could
judge for ourselves the might and fighting customs of
the white men. It was necessary for us to do this,
as at that time we knew but little of the white
man, or the war customs of the soldiers; and as
we might have to fight them later on, it was well
for us to know their manners in war. We travelled
together, in two parties, as our love is not great
for the Uriwera, and reached the land of the
Waikatos. These could give us but a short tangi
(reception ceremony), as the war was hot in the
land and the people much engaged in fighting; but
they gave us the Orakau Pah to dwell in, until
such time as the runanga could be held. Some
chiefs of the Waikatos also stayed with us in the
pah, as hosts, and food was sent us daily, our women,
some forty in number, having to fetch water from
a distance, as there was none close to the pah.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We heard daily of the advance of the white men,
and we hoped to see them, but did not go near
them. It would not have been right to do so: we
were on a visit of ceremony, we had no anger
against them, and no cause to fight with them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One day we heard they were quite near, and
our hearts were glad, as perhaps we should get our
desire and gaze on them. Next day they came in
sight, long columns of them, each man in his place.
And it was good to look at them. They were in great
numbers. We had never seen so many men at one
time, and our hearts grew dark within us at their
might and order. Instead of passing on their way
as we expected, some of them turned to the right
and some moved to our left, until we were quite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
surrounded; and when they were all placed they
stood still and remained quiet. We were surprised
and in great wonder; nor could we understand the
meaning of this, until there came to us, as herald,
the mouth (interpreter) of their war chief, who told
us, in the name of the Great White Queen, to give
up the pah, lay down our arms, and render ourselves
prisoners to the white men. Our head chief
told him that we could not do this, that we were
not there to fight against the white man, but that
we were Taupo and Uriwera Maoris, that we were
on a visit of ceremony to the Waikatos, and that
we had no anger or cause against the soldiers.
But the white chief was mad, and sent the mouth
again, saying we must give up the pah to him or
he would attack us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our hearts were very dark with fear at the might
and number of the soldiers, and we discussed the
situation. How could we give up the pah? Had
not the Waikatos lent us their pah to live in? And
were we not responsible for the honour of it? How
could we give it up? No, we must guard the pah
with our lives, or our disgrace would resound
through the land and our shame live for ever. We
had no wish to fight the soldiers, but we must.
Now the white man is not ceremonious, for he
gave us no time to dress for war, dance the war-dance,
nor even to utter our war-cries; for as soon
as the herald returned to his chief we saw a taua
(war party) leave their army and come straight for
the outer fence, and we had to hasten, so as to get
into the trench and flanking angles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very great is the courage of the soldiers, but
great is their folly; for this taua moved all in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
body, close together, with a young chief walking in
front of them with his sword in his hand. Soon
they came near, and the young chief raised his
sword and shouted. The taua at once rushed at
us, all of them shouting loud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our hearts were dark with fear, for the anger
of the white man was very great. Rewi (a great
fighting chief of the Waikatos&rsquo;) had told us before
to harden ourselves against the anger and shouts
of the white men, and had given us orders not to
fire until he gave the signal, then all to fire at one
time. When the taua was within six fathoms of us
he gave the signal, and our fire darted out from
under the fence. Many of the white men fell, but
the rest rushed on, some of them trying to pull
down the fence with their hands, others firing
through it with their guns, and some thrusting at
us with their bayonets. None of them seemed to
fear death, though they fell fast. We now fired our
second barrels, reloading as fast as we could, the
women helping us, the men in the flanking angles
also firing, so that the smoke rose in clouds, and
the sky resounded with the shouting of the white
men and our war-cries. All fear had fallen away
from us, and we now saw that the great white chief
was ceremonious, as he had only sent such a
number of men as we could cope with, all his other
men remaining where they had first stopped and
not interfering with us. But it was otherwise
with the men with whom we were fighting, as they
swore at us and called us many bad names. And
this was wrong, and filled us with wonder, as we
had done them no evil. But perhaps it is the custom
of the soldiers to do so.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The fight had lasted but a short time. I had
loaded my tupara (double-barrelled gun) twice
when a bugle called out, and the soldiers, leaving
us, went back. No, they did not run away, they
went slowly, looking back at us as if sorry to leave
the fight and taking their wounded men with them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were greatly elated that we had saved the
pah, and thought that now the white men, having
no cause of war against us, and having done all
that was necessary for both their own honour and
ours, would pass on their way, leaving us in peace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was also near the time for our evening meal.
The Waikato women had not, according to their
custom, brought us any provisions that day, this
having been delayed, we thought, on account of
the fight. But as that was now over, there could
be no further cause for their not coming, and if our
women were to fetch water, it would be ready for
the food when it presently arrived.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our women left the pah for this purpose, and
had been gone but a short time when they returned
and told us that the soldiers would not
allow them to pass, and that, on their insisting on
doing so, telling the interpreter that there was no
water or food in the pah and that they must get
some, the mouth had told them that the big chief
had given orders that no food or water should be
carried into the pah and that if they passed through
the soldiers they would be prevented from coming
back. So they had returned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This news filled us with wonder. Surely the
white chief must be mad. Enough fighting had
been done for the honour of ourselves and the
soldiers. Even should he require more, how could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
he expect our hearts to be strong and for us to be
able to fight well if he was to stop us obtaining
food and water? It was folly. No man can fight as
he should do when he is weak and famished. He
had very many men. There had not been 300
Maoris, including women, in the pah from the
beginning, and some of us had been killed and
wounded; so we felt bitter towards the white chief,
for our thirst with fighting, shouting and the
powder smoke, was great.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Next morning we saw many more soldiers had
arrived, bringing with them several big guns, and
the herald again approached us. This time he
told us that if we would not render up the pah
the big guns would fire on us. He also said we
should have no food or water. To this Rewi made
answer: &lsquo;We will not render up the pah and our
honour. Enough, we will fight right on for ever.&rsquo;
And we all shouted, &lsquo;Ak&eacute;, ak&eacute;, ak&eacute;&rsquo; (For ever, for
ever, for ever).</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the white chief sent word: &lsquo;Save your
women, let them come out, they shall pass in
safety and honour through the soldiers.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the women refused, and Rewi answered:
&lsquo;The women will fight with us.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No sooner had the herald left us than the big
guns began to shoot, also some short, fat guns
(cohorns) that threw iron balls up into the air, so
that they dropped inside the pah. And these balls,
being filled with powder, burst, inside the pah, with
great noise, and pieces of iron flew all around,
while a great number of soldiers, drawing near,
began to fire at the pah, so that soon the whole
place was filled with dust and confusion, while the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
air was torn with the shrieking of the pieces of iron
and the whistling of bullets. We were stricken
with fear, and were glad to take refuge in the
underground houses of the Waikatos. And now we
understood their reason for building these, and our
fear soon left us, when we discovered that all this
noise and trouble did us no harm. After this had
gone on some time, Rewi called to us that a taua
was getting ready to attack us, and ordered us to
make ready for it. And just then the fire from
the big guns ceased, so as to enable us to
do so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This was quite right, for, if they had continued to
fire, we could not have left the underground houses,
and then should not have had time to get into the
trenches to welcome the soldiers. This made us
think better of the white chief, who, we now saw,
was most ceremonious, as he again only sent as
many men against us as we could contend with on
equal terms. And in all things, except the matter
of food and water, he proved himself to be a great
and wise war chief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The hapu (tribe) of soldiers sent against us this
time was not the same tribe as that which had
attacked us previously, as they wore another number
on their head-dress. And this was as it should be,
for the chief had many different tribes in his army,
and each of these must be given a chance of honour.
But he must have been blind in his great folly, as
if he wished to send all his tribes, each in its turn,
against us, at the same time refusing us food and
water, how could he expect us to keep our hearts
strong, so as to be able to resist in a befitting
manner those whose turn came later on? Then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
again our powder would fail. But this he had
provided against, as I will tell you shortly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now this new taua acted just the same as the
other had done. They all moved in a body, and
when the chief, who walked in front, raised his
weapon they all ran forward to try and tear down
the outer fence. Some of them had also brought
with them large tomahawks with which to cut it
down, and Rewi called to us to use our second
shots on these men. Shouting loudly, the taua
charged at us, and when they reached within six
fathoms of us our fire rushed to meet them.
Many of them fell, and those who reached the
fence failed to break in, though they did all
that brave men could do. The men with the
tomahawks were soon shot down, and the fight
waxed very hot, although our war-cries were small,
our thirst being very great.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soon the bugle again called, and the white men
went back slowly and in great anger, some of them
shaking their hands at us and swearing loudly. But
this we did not heed greatly, as we had decided,
among ourselves, that this was their custom and
that they did so with no intent to insult us, who
had done them no wrong.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soon the big guns began to shoot again: this
time at the pekaranga (outer fence), so as to try
and break it down. But the fence was made of very
many slender manuka poles, lashed firmly to many
cross-pieces, these being made fast to stout posts
set firmly in the ground, the lower part of the fence
being just clear of the ground, so that we could fire
under it from the trench that was just behind it.
And behind this trench, in which we stood, were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
the earthworks and heavy palisading of the
pah.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now the outer fence being composed in this
way, the shot from the big guns only broke one
or at the most two sticks of the fence, and then
buried themselves in the earth. This did but little
harm to us, as the holes made in the fence could
be easily repaired and were not nearly large enough
for a soldier to pass through. The short, fat guns
also began to throw their balls into the pah. But
as long as we remained in the underground houses
these did us no harm. And it was by them the
white chief showed his wisdom, insomuch as he
employed these balls to furnish us with powder, so
as to enable us to continue fighting, as we quickly
discovered that very many of these balls did not
burst and from them we extracted very many
charges of powder. All these big guns fired with
great fury at us for some time, and then ceased, so
as to give us the opportunity of getting into the
trenches to receive another taua.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This came in the same manner as the previous
ones, and went back as they did, not being able to
break through the fence, and losing many men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the rest of that day the big guns continued
to shoot at us and the soldiers to fire into the pah,
while we suffered much from the want of food and
water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That evening the mouth came to us again with
word from the chief to render the pah and ourselves
to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This we again refused to do. True, we had
fought enough to save the honour of the pah, and
we should have left it before, had we been able to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
do so; but we were, on all sides, surrounded by
soldiers, so could not escape. And if we rendered
ourselves up as prisoners, we, who were, with but
few exceptions, all well-born rangitera (gentlemen),
would lose caste and become slaves. Therefore we
must fight for ever, even if we should have to die
from thirst. All that evening, and also at intervals
during the night, the big guns fired at us; and we
had to take the time between these to lick with
our tongues the dew that fell from the sky, so as to
try and cool our parched throats, as by now our
thirst was very great.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We could get no rest that night, as the white
men frequently fired these powder-filled balls into
the pah. And we discovered another reason for
their use: one being to bring us powder, the other
to keep us awake, so as to be ready to resist an
attack should the chief desire one to be made.
We had thought, at first, they had been intended
to kill and injure us, but as they had hurt no one,
we now understood their proper use. And we again
wondered at a chief who, being so wise in some
matters, should be so foolish as to keep us without
food and water, as he still had many more tribes
to send to fight us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Next morning we saw that the white men had
dug, during the night, many rifle pits, and had
begun to dig trenches, so as to be able to approach
us closely, without our being able to fire at them.
Escape we had deemed impossible before, but
when the mouth came to call us to render ourselves
prisoners, we again cried, as loud as our thirst
allowed us: &lsquo;We fight on; ak&eacute;, ak&eacute;, ak&eacute;.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That day the big guns fired frequently, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
tauas attacked us twice, always in the same
manner as I have already told you; but the last
taua were very full of anger, and the bugle had
to call twice before they left us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The soldiers also kept on digging their trenches,
and kept on firing both from big guns and muskets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;During the night we again tried to quench our
thirst with the dew, for we were getting weak and
suffering greatly; and Rewi with the rest of us
chiefs consulted as to what we should do, for we
saw that by the next evening the soldiers would
have dug their trenches up to the outer fence and
that the pah must fall. These were the words of
Rewi, and we all agreed with them:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;O ye chiefs of Taupo and Uriwera, we have
done all that brave men can do. We have saved
the honour of the pah, we must now look to
ourselves. The soldiers will enter the pah to-morrow,
and we, through the folly of the white
chief, will be too weak from famine and thirst to
resist them. It is unbecoming that we, who are
gentlemen, should render ourselves prisoners; therefore
only one thing remains for us to do. We must
charge the enemy and try to escape by breaking
through them. Perchance some of us will succeed,
the remainder must die as it befits warriors to die.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He then told us his plan. &lsquo;At midday the
soldiers take their meal, leaving only guards in the
trenches. We will leave the pah quietly in a body
and rush those who are behind the bank&mdash;that is, in
front of the gate&mdash;and we will break through them
there. They will be eating. Perchance we may
find them unprepared.&rsquo; To this we all agreed,
each man determining to escape or die.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Next morning we saw the trenches had approached
us closely, and so near were they that the
soldiers were able to throw great numbers of small
balls filled with powder into our trench and the
pah itself. These balls burst on reaching us, and
were thrown by the hands of the soldiers themselves,
not by the big guns, though these also kept firing
all the time, and we saw before night came again
the pah must fall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No taua attacked us this morning, as they
wished the big guns to break down our defences,
as much as possible, before they again assailed us.
The sun reached its height and the firing somewhat
ceased. Rewi said the time was come, and we
gathered together at the gate of the pah, all the
women being with us. Yes, it was certainly the
time for the soldiers&rsquo; meal, and we, who had neither
eaten nor drunk for more than three days, tried
to laugh when we thought how we were shortly to
disturb their eating it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Parion, so that you may understand fully
how these matters took place, I must tell you that
about 100 fathoms from the gate of the pah was
a bank, behind which were one of the tribes of
soldiers, who bore the number 40 on their head-coverings.
This bank had not been dug by them
but was natural. It was not a high bank, and it
sloped towards us, but was steeper on the other
side and afforded the soldiers good protection from
such of us as possessed rifles. There had been
no trenches dug on this side of the pah, as the
ground was hard and rocky, so there was nothing
between us and this bank. When we were all
ready the gate of the pah was removed, and we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
all rushed out, but without noise, and ran as fast as
we could for the bank; and we had crossed more
than half the distance before the soldiers seemed
to notice us, as the smoke and dust lay heavy on
the pah and around the spots from which the big
guns fired. Then we were seen, and immediately
many bugles gave their calls. There was much
shouting, and many soldiers in the trenches jumped
out and fired at us, many others running to take
their allotted places. There was much confusion.
We, however, ran steadily on, turning neither to
our right nor our left; nor did we return the fire.
We soon came to the bank, and as we ran up the
slope we could see the soldiers rising from the
ground, on which they were eating, and who, when
they saw us running towards them, ran to the bank,
fixing their bayonets on their guns. Only a few
had time to fire at us before we were on them, and
with our rush we jumped from the top of the bank
right over their heads. Some of them thrust
bayonets at us, but as they were in confusion we
broke through them, or jumped over them, without
trouble, only very few of us falling here, and continued
to run towards the hills that were not far
off. We should have reached these, and most
of us would have escaped, but all at once we
were cut off and attacked by other men, not
soldiers, some of them mounted (Colonial Irregulars).
These men do not have the fine appearance
of soldiers, but know more about war,
and are greatly to be feared; for they did not wait
to get each man into his right place, but attacked
us each man as he could, and being, moreover, good
fighting men, they killed many of us and delayed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
us so much that the soldiers, having had time to
regulate themselves, reached the hill almost as soon
as we did. They were in great numbers and fired
heavily on us as we struggled up the hills, all of
us so weak that we could scarcely surmount them.
The big guns also fired at us, but the horses could
not follow us, and so 120 of us escaped, Rewi and
myself being among these, the remainder dying as
it became them. Very many of us, however, were
wounded; and I must not omit to tell you that thirty
of the others who did not escape, through being
wounded severely, were taken by the soldiers.
These the soldiers treated with honour; nor did
they make them slaves or kill them, but conveyed
them carefully to big tents, where their wounds were
made whole, and they were attended with much
care. The women, of whom some were taken, were
also treated with honour. But this was the custom
of the soldiers once the fighting was finished.
They bore no anger towards the Maori prisoners,
but brought them much tobacco and waipero (rum)
to show their good will and appreciation for the
trouble the Maoris had taken to fight them five
times. But on the medicine men learning of this
good will on the part of the soldiers, they were
angry, and drove them away; which I myself
consider to be wrong. But perchance it is the
custom of the medicine men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, Te Parione, I desire your explanation
on some matters; for my heart is darkened with indecision
as to the reasons the great white chief had in
carrying the war on against us in the manner he did.
You, who are a fighting man, belonging to the tribes
of soldiers, for I have been told your ancestors have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
all been chiefs among these tribes, may be able to
clear my mind on these matters. I will place my
ideas before you, then you can make my mind light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First, why did the chief attack us? We were
on a visit of ceremony, not of war. Yet he, having
a big army, and the Waikatos at the time avoiding
him, must find war for his men. In so much he
was right, and that I understand. Again, he showed
great knowledge of war, by only sending small
bodies of men against us, he having so many that
we should have been crushed at once had he sent
them all at the same time. He also showed his
great wisdom by sending us powder in the iron
balls, which also kept us awake at night, so that
we might be ready in case he attacked us. But as
he did not attack us during the night, it was folly,
as a fighting man needs rest. That he did not
want to kill us we know, or he would not have
made whole the wounded men. Again, he could
not have wanted the pah itself, to dwell in, or he
would not have tried to destroy it with his big guns.
And he knew we had no food or water, so must all
perish from thirst, in a few days, when he could
gain the pah without losing any men at all. He
could not want our arms, as his men do not use
double-barrelled guns, and if he took them from
us we should have been unable to fight him, in
case he saw fit to come to Taupo from the Waikato,
seeking war. No, he must have wanted to let each
of his tribes enjoy the honour of fighting us in
their proper turn. But then why, O Te Parione,
did he forbid us food and water? How could he
expect us to render full justice to his men when
our great thirst even prevented us from crying our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
war-cries, or fighting in such a manner as would
confer honour on his men whose turn came late.
As it was, we could only manage to hold out long
enough to fight five of his tribes: and he had many.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, Te Parione, the night grows old, and I
have talked much. Thinking of Orakau excites my
thirst and the rum bottle is empty. At daylight you
go to shoot ducks, and it is needful to sleep. Think
over what I have asked you, and to-morrow night,
when we talk once again on war, you will be able
to set my mind at rest on these matters. War is
a great art, and we are never too old to acquire
wisdom. Perchance that white chief had reasons
that, if I understood, would exalt my name should
I practise them when we fight again. Till then,
my guest, rest in peace.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The above yarn is greatly epitomised, as my old
host not only described most of the blows struck
during the fight, but also gave me the roll-call of
the Maoris, and most of their pedigrees. A Maori
considers it to be a waste of words not to describe
minutely every circumstance of an event, and by
doing so differs from our ideas of yarn-spinning, as
we consider brevity to be the soul of wit. Nor did
the brave old warrior lay claim to any special merit
that his band of 250 men, armed with old fowling-pieces
and muskets, should have resisted the attack
of over 5000 British troops, should have repulsed
five desperate assaults, and for three days have
braved the fire of a powerful train of artillery, while
at the same time undergoing the torture of thirst.</p>

<p>Surely their heroic answer to the General&rsquo;s
summons to surrender, &ldquo;Ka whawhai tonu, ak&eacute;, ak&eacute;,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>ak&eacute;&rdquo; (We fight right on, for ever, for ever, for ever),
is worthy of a place among the mottoes of the
proudest regiments the world has ever contained.
As for their desperate and somewhat successful
attempt to escape: the fact that this handful of
famished men and women, in broad daylight, should
charge and break through the investing lines of
their enemies and, but for the intervention of the
Colonial Irregulars, would have nearly all got away,
is a wonderful instance of unconquerable courage.</p>

<span class="caption">REWI.</span>
</div>

<p>Perhaps I may be excused for recounting one or
two more instances of Maori chivalry.</p>

<p>During the negotiations that took place at the
end of the Waikato war, the General asked Wirimu
Thomihana, through his interpreter, how it was
that the Maoris had not attempted to cut off his
convoys at a place called the Hog&rsquo;s Back?&mdash;the
said place having such natural difficulties as to
render its passage almost impossible, had it been
obstructed by a hostile force. Thomihana&rsquo;s reply
was: &ldquo;What a foolish question for a great war chief
to ask. If we had prevented you from obtaining
food, how could you have continued to fight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>On another occasion two companies of soldiers,
while on the line of march, piled their arms, sat
down to rest and eat their dinners. Not far away a
body of Maoris were lying <i>perdus</i>. These crept up,
through the long fern, to the unsuspecting Tommies.
Then, jumping to their feet, rushed through them,
seizing <i>en route</i> all the rifles, belts and pouches,
they disappeared with them again into the fern.
The Maori chief presently informed the discomfited
and helpless troops that he would not
allow his men to injure them, as he considered that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
both themselves and their officers were far too
ignorant of war to be treated as warriors, and that
they might therefore return in peace to their camp,
where he advised them to learn how to take care of
themselves before they again came out to fight.</p>

<p>The 65th Regiment had been stationed very
many years in New Zealand, it being supposed
that their existence had been forgotten by the War
Office, who had most probably lost their postal
address. Some of the officers and very many of
the men had married Maori women, so that the
regiment was on very friendly terms with the
natives. War broke out, and, naturally, the white
man and Maori were on opposite sides and fought
bravely against one another. This did not, however,
affect their mutual esteem, for when at sunset the
firing ceased numbers of Maoris used to leave
their rifle pits and stroll over to their opponents&rsquo;
shelter trenches to exchange compliments, while
the Maori women brought over plentiful supplies
of pork and potatoes with which to regale their
husbands, who, during the day, had been trying their
best to pot their fathers and brothers. These
latter, with plenty of quiet chaff, would quietly
discuss the prominent events of the past day&rsquo;s
fighting, and the possible occurrences of the coming
one, with no more animus than teams of cricketers
discuss together, at dinner, the events of that day&rsquo;s
play. At guard-mounting these friendly enemies
would part, and at daylight next morning each
would do his level best to put out of action his
relative by marriage. This sporting relationship
was kept up for some time, until, reinforcements
pouring into the country, another regiment was sent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
to strengthen the Haki-Hakis (the 65th), when the
Maoris, thinking that the new-comers might be
enemies to the 65th, promptly left their rifle pits
and, coming over to their opponents, proffered their
assistance to drive away the supposed undesirable
new-comers, and then continue their own fight.</p>

<p>I have frequently talked to Maori warriors of
their old-time wars, tribe against tribe, when they
have related accounts of the awful raids of Hongi,
Heki, Rauparaha and others. And these stories not
only teem with incidents of splendid courage, but
are also blackened by the recital of as many acts
of brutality, treachery and cold-blooded slaughter
sufficient to satisfy Moloch himself: and relate to
men who would on one occasion perform feats of
heroic chivalry worthy to stand beside those of
Bayard or Sir Walter Manny, while on the next
day they would commit acts that would have been
considered bad form in Hades even by Tilly and
Cromwell. Chivalry was to disappear entirely when
the natives adopted the extraordinary and debased
form of nonconformist Christianity called the Pai
Marire or Hau Hau faith: at which time, retaining
only their courage, they relinquished every other
good quality they may ever have possessed.</p>

<p>During the bitter and savage fighting of the later
sixties, splendid actions were done by these men
while attempting to carry off, from the field of battle,
their wounded or dead comrades; and their determined
resistance, offered up to the last, threw
a halo of glory round them that even their cold-blooded
murders and torturing atrocities could
scarcely obliterate.</p>

<p>Well I think I have said enough about their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
courage; let me turn to the next greatest virtue
possessed by man&mdash;viz. hospitality.</p>

<p>The hospitality of the Maori was unbounded. The
best of everything he had was readily placed at the
disposal of his guest, and even should he be so circumstanced
as to have only a few potatoes between
himself and starvation, these would be cheerfully
surrendered for his visitor&rsquo;s consumption; nor was
any payment expected, and if offered would have
been indignantly refused; notwithstanding the fact
that the recipient of the bounty might be a perfect
stranger.</p>

<p>In those good old days, when the inmates of
a pah or kainga saw a white man, of any rank
or position, approaching the place, all the women,
girls and children would seize mats, or anything
else that came handy, and, waving these, cry as
loud as they could the greetings of welcome:
&ldquo;Hacre mai! Hacre mai!&rdquo; (Come to us! Come to
us!). And these cries would continue, and be joined
in by all the inhabitants, until the stranger had
entered the village. On doing so, the visitor,
provided he were acquainted with strict Maori
etiquette, would pay no attention to anyone, but,
handing his horse over to the nearest boy, pass
through the screaming, gesticulating crowd, and
seat himself in front of the guest hut, usually the
best whare in the village. Here he would be
faced by all the principal men of the place, who
would squat down, in a semicircle, in front of him,
the women, boys, girls and men of low degree
standing in rear of them, when with one accord the
whole multitude would lift up their voices and
weep&mdash;and when I say weep it was weeping, real<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
weeping, and no make-believe about it. This
weeping, known as a tangi, was to me always
a matter of wonder, as I could never understand
how a Maori should be able to turn on the water-tap
of his emotions at any moment he might desire
to do so. I have frequently seen scores of grand
old kai tangatas (man-eaters) squat down and,
at will, cry and sob, with big tears hopping down
their tattooed cheeks, as bitterly as some tender-hearted
little girls would do if their favourite
cat had just murdered their pet canary; and these
grim old warriors, in less than a minute, would be
in more urgent need of a big bandana handkerchief
than a small boy with a bad attack of influenza.
Old men and women would crawl out of their huts,
stragglers would hurry up to join the throng, until
every man, woman and child belonging to the
tribe would be rocking and wailing as if their very
heart-strings had been wrung with woe by the most
personal disaster.</p>

<p>After these lamentations had lasted a few
minutes, one of the principal chiefs would rise to
his feet and make a short oration, somewhat in this
fashion: &ldquo;You have come to us, O stranger,
welcome! welcome! welcome!&rdquo; Then, turning to
his people, he would say: &ldquo;What is the use of this
crying? Dry your tears. Our friend is with us,
make him welcome. He is hungry, prepare food
for him. He is fatigued, let him rest. Bring him
water, let him drink. Our friend is with us, cease
this foolish weeping. Our hearts grow light at
seeing him.&rdquo; He would then advance to the
visitor and offer his hand, in the case of a white
man; but if the said stranger should be a native,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
of rank or family, he would squat down in front
of him and rub noses. Then, placing their hands
each on the other&rsquo;s shoulders, they would dissolve
once more into tears, mussle their noses together,
and for a minute or two mingle their weepings: this
process having to be gone through by the stranger
with every man in the village, whose rank entitled
him to approach the guest.</p>

<p>The salutations having been finished, the stranger
was left in peace, everyone retiring, with the
exception of a chief, or some particular friend, who
would remain to see to his comfort. And here at
once the innate good-breeding of the Maori came
to the front: insomuch as, no matter how
anxious the natives were to hear the news, or the
purport of the visit, the guest was never pestered
with questions, not even as from whence he came,
or whither he was going, and it remained entirely
to his own discretion as to whether he gave them
any information or not. In the meantime, girls
brought him water to drink and wash with, others
had swept out the whare, brought in fresh fern and
laid down new mats for his use. Presently the
sound of singing would be heard, and a group of
girls, carrying small open trays made from the
broad, glazed leaves of the flax plant, would, with
a dancing step and a little song, approach him and
place them in front of him. These trays contained
food, such as pork, eels, enunga (fresh-water whitebait),
kora (the delicious fresh-water crayfish),
potatoes, pigeons, and sweet potatoes, or any of
them the village contained. Anyhow, the guest
might be quite sure it was the very best his hosts
had to offer. On their arrival the man who had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
been looking after him would take a morsel of
food from one dish and eat it; then, rising to his
feet, he would retire, at the same time wishing his
guest a good appetite. Everyone else would depart
with him, with the exception of one or, perhaps,
two girls, who would remain on their knees beside
him, to wait on him and tempt him to eat.</p>

<p>The evening meal being over, the chiefs would
gather round their guest, and, if he should happen
to be a man of any importance, long and deep
would be the conversation: the subjects ranging
from the health and doings of the Great White
Queen and her governor, to the most trivial topics
of the day. Each man in his turn would state his
ideas and reasons, and was listened to with attention;
while the guest&rsquo;s words were carefully weighed, and
even, if his hearers disagreed with him, the arguments
adduced to refute his statements were
always expressed in a manner so polite, and in
words so carefully chosen, that it was impossible
for him to feel personally hurt in regard to his
<i>amour propre</i>. Of course if the visit had been
premeditated the stranger would have come amply
supplied with tobacco, which would be passed
round, and accepted with a <i>bien aise</i> that quite
disguised, or rather hid, their intense longing for
it, and would be enjoyed with many a hearty grunt
of satisfaction and approbation. Then the girls
would haka (dance with songs) in the moonlight,
some of them having placed glow-worms and fireflies
in their hair. And the sight of flashing eyes, gleaming
white teeth, flowing locks and lovely, swaying
figures was sufficient to have made old Saint
Anthony himself sit up; although the words of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
songs that accompanied the dances, and the
gestures that in part composed them, were of
a nature to shock a far less austere saint, and
would perhaps have even extracted a blush from
an habitu&eacute; of the old-time Jardin Mabille.</p>

<p>Late night would put an end to the festivities,
and the stranger, all his comforts well seen to,
might retire to his fern bed in peace.</p>

<p>It was a point of honour among the Maoris to
protect their guest, as it was a point of honour, on
the part of the guest, to stand by his hosts. In the
yarn I spun about Orakau, I pointed out how the
Taupo and Uriwera tribes refused to render up
the pah lent to them to dwell in by the Waikatos,
and that sooner than do so they fought to the
bitter end. Again, in 1811, when Te Kooti, flying
from us, took refuge in the King Country, and
demanded the protection of the Waikatos, this was
readily granted him; and the Waikato tribes,
although they had no personal esteem for him,
much less love or even family ties, would have
gone to war with us rather than have surrendered
him, had the New Zealand Government demanded
him from them.</p>

<p>A Maori tribe considered it most unfortunate
should even an accident befall a guest while
dwelling in one of their villages; for if such an
occurrence should happen, they ran the risk of
being chaffed and held up to ridicule, by the
surrounding tribes, for their inability to take care
of a visitor.</p>

<p>Much more so was this the case during war-time.
Should a white officer be detailed for duty to
a native contingent, he would be looked after and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
his safety guarded in ways almost ludicrous and
by no means congenial to himself.</p>

<p>This was done, because if that officer were killed
or wounded, it would reflect the deepest disgrace
on the tribe with whom he served; they would
never hear the last of it, not only from their friends,
but also from their enemies. And these would
continually rate them, and charge them with the
accusation that it was through their carelessness
or cowardice that the misfortune had happened
to the man who had been entrusted to them.</p>

<p>The Maori was very superstitious. He firmly
believed in dreams, visions, omens of all sorts and
the gift of prophecy, while the number of unlucky
acts he might involuntarily commit during one
day was quite sufficient to account for a whole
chapter of accidents on the morrow. He regarded
the tohungas (magicians) with great respect,
so long as their divinations and prophecies panned
out; but there are plenty of well-authenticated
cases where a warrior has wreaked his vengeance
on a tohunga through whose false prognostications
the tribe has got into a mess. Nor are
incidents lacking to show that prophets, who had
earned a reputation for themselves, would not
rather commit suicide than allow themselves to be
proved wrong in their divinations.</p>

<p>Let me spin you a couple of yarns to illustrate
what I have just written.</p>

<p>It was in March 1865 that the Hau Hau apostle
Kereopa, in the course of a few hours, converted
the swagger flock of red-hot Christians, who, under
the guidance of Bishop Williams, had earned a
mighty reputation for sanctity, to the new faith of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
Pai Marire. The good bishop and his family,
barely escaping with their lives from his own
sheep, departed to Napier, leaving the Hau Haus
in possession of his residence at Waerengahika, at
which place they built a pah that was, in November
of the same year, attacked by the Colonial forces.
The Hau Haus were superior in numbers, but during
the first few days the Colonials gained some trivial
advantages, and on the fourth day began to sap
up to the works, which they had surrounded. This
day chanced to be a Saturday, and the working
party were surprised by an attack, in their rear,
from a body of the enemy&rsquo;s reinforcements seeking
to enter the pah, which they succeeded in doing,
the working party having to beat a retreat, with
the loss of six men killed and five wounded. This
trivial success greatly elated the natives and so
bucked up one of the apostles that he at once
started in and prophesied nineteen to the dozen.</p>

<p>Now this Johnny possessed that small amount of
knowledge that is so dangerous to its owner. He
had been brought up at a mission station, and
accustomed to going to church, with great regularity,
every Sunday. He therefore thought that all
Christians acted in the same way, and that the
Colonial Irregulars would be just as methodical
in their religious observance as the goody-goody
hangers-on at the various mission stations he was
acquainted with.</p>

<p>Here of course he made a blooming error, for
what member of the Lost Legion ever allowed
preaching to interfere with fighting, or carried
devotional books about with him when he had to
hump his own swag.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>Now this josser, thinking he knew all about the
customs of the white man, considered he was quite
safe in turning on his prophetic tap. So on the
evening after the small success already spoken
about he started in and informed his hearers that
he had received a revelation, directing the Hau
Haus that on the following day, which was Sunday,
they were to leave the pah an hour before noon
and advance on the white men&rsquo;s shelter trenches,
which they would find empty, and that the majority
of the latter who had not been turned into stone
by the angel Gabriel would be surprised at their
devotions and fall a prey, without any resistance,
to the tender mercies of the Hau Haus, who, he
guaranteed, were to escape, scathless, from wounds
or death.</p>

<p>These promises seem absurd to white men, but
they were implicitly believed by the Maoris, who
next day acted on the strength of them.</p>

<p>The main position of the Colonials was in the rear
of three strong thorn hedges, two of which flanked
the third, and these had all been well trenched
and were, of course, held, day and night, by a
strong guard; in fact the men lived and slept in
them. Between the centre hedge and the pah, a
distance of less that 500 yards, stretched a smooth
meadow, without a particle of cover, and the
astonishment of our men was intense when, at
11 o&rsquo;clock <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, they saw some hundreds of the
Hau Haus quietly leave the pah and advance in
two wedge-shaped columns against the centre of
their position. At first they thought it was a
general surrender, but the war flags the enemy
carried rapidly dispersed that idea; and when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
two columns were well between the three hedges,
and not 100 yards from any of them, the bugle
sounded and a tremendous volley was poured
into the misguided Maoris, who fell in heaps of
dead and wounded men. Notwithstanding the
awful shock their nerves must have received from
this quite unexpected slaughter, these gallant
though fanatical warriors at once charged home
and tried to force their way through the strong
thorn fence, only to be swept away like flies. And
soon the survivors had to beat a hasty retreat back
to the pah, lashed the whole way by the heavy
fire of the white men, who did not go to church.</p>

<p>It was during the advance that the incident I
originally alluded to took place. The first volley
had smashed the Hau Haus&rsquo; leading column, the
advance of which the apostle led in person; for, to
give these prophets only their just due, they never
hung back from taking the post of the greatest
danger in any of the crazy enterprises that they
persuaded their disciples to undertake.</p>

<p>Well, the first volley knocked over the prophet,
who fell badly wounded, but succeeded in regaining
his feet, whereupon one of the chiefs, disengaging
himself from the mass of stricken and shaken men,
deliberately walked up to him, drew his tomahawk
and cleft his skull, then, springing forward, led his
surviving followers to almost certain death. This
might be called an instance of sharp and ready
reckoning, but it was by no means a singular case
of rough and rapid retribution; so that, taking into
consideration the number of apostles who were
knocked over, in a legitimate manner, fighting,
and those who were tomahawked by furious and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
disappointed votaries, the trade could scarcely be
called a healthy one, and it must have required a
great amount of pluck on the man&rsquo;s part who took
on himself the prophetic r&ocirc;le. But, then, what will
not some men risk for notoriety?</p>

<p>Now, having finished with this Johnny, let me
tell you about another of a somewhat similar kidney.</p>

<p>The friendly tribes of the Wanganui sent a
contingent to the east coast, to assist us during
the Opotiki Expedition, and among them was a
first-class, up-to-date prophet named Pitau. The
Wanganui, at this time, were not strong in prophets,
so that this man was made much of by his tribe,
for although some of the young men had begun to
deride prophecy, yet the old warriors still implicitly
believed in the ancient cult, and regarded Pitau as
a valuable adjunct to the field force.</p>

<p>Now it was the usual custom of the various
tribes, when they went to war, to hold deep consultations
with their tribal prophets, who for a
consideration would advise and foretell what was
going to happen, and if the war was going to prove
successful or otherwise. It was so in this case.
Pitau was called on to lift the veil of futurity, and,
having gone through the necessary incantations,
the oracle spoke as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;You will be successful
in all things, O Wanganui: only one man
will die, and that man will be Pitau.&rdquo; Now this
was distinctly rough on Pitau, who must either die
or be declared an impostor. Anyhow, the oracle
had spoken, and the war party started. The
Wanganui reached Opotiki, did their duty well,
and on the completion of their service were to take
ship for home. Up to this time nearly everything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
had panned out all right for the soothsayer, with
regard to his prophecy: the Wanganui had been
successful and had not lost a single man; but the
oracle had distinctly stated Pitau was to die himself,
yet here he was still alive. It certainly was
not his fault, for at the fight at the Kiori-kino, and
also in other skirmishes, he had done his best to
get killed, but seemed to bear a charmed life; yet if
he returned home alive, his name and reputation as
a high-toned prophet would be gone for ever. The
Fates, however, gave him one more chance, and he
grasped it. Canoes, heavily ladened, were pushing
off from the shore to the ship: he sprang into one
of these, and by his extra weight swamped the
canoe. The amphibious natives easily swam ashore,
but so did not Pitau, for, raising his arms above his
head, he allowed himself to sink down to his rest,
among the eels and crabs, rather than allow his
prophecy to be unfulfilled. Surely there are many
names on the scroll of martyrs who have laid down
their lives, to prove the truth of their convictions,
less worthy of fame than that of Pitau.</p>

<p>And now I think I may spin you a yarn about
a personal experience I had of the superstitious
fears of the Maoris, although by doing so I must
confess to a <i>mauvaise plaisanterie</i> I was guilty of
perpetrating, and of which I am thoroughly
ashamed, that created a greater emotion, among a
party of highly respectable old cannibals, than any
convulsion of nature would have caused.</p>

<p>It happened in this way: I was well aware of
the great superstitious dread the Maoris had
of the green lizard. These, although they exist
in New Zealand, are rare birds, and during the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
years I was there I saw but few of them. The
Maoris, however, believe that at death one of
these lizards enters a man&rsquo;s body, and consequently
look on them with horror and abhorrence. At the
period I am yarning about, I was located at
Ohinimutu, in the hot lake district, and had made
a short visit to the town of Napier.</p>

<p>During my stay there, while wandering about
the streets, I noticed that a speculative storekeeper
had added some children&rsquo;s toys to his stock in trade,
perhaps the very first that had ever been imported
into the country, and as they attracted my
attention I stopped to examine them. We are
told that Old Nick is ever ready to prompt an idle
man, and he must have been mighty adjacent to
me that day, for on my spotting one of those old-fashioned,
wooden crocodiles, painted a vivid green
with bright-red spots on it, I immediately went
into the shop and purchased it. The thing was
constructed of small blocks of wood, sawn in such
a way, and connected together with string, that
when you held it in your hand it wriggled, and
looked alive, while it also possessed a gaping red
mouth and staring eyes. The confounded insect
would not have raised a squall out of a nervous
European babe of a year old; but, such as it was,
I put it into my kit and, on my return up country,
took it with me.</p>

<p>In due course of time I reached Ohinimutu,
where, after a swim in the hot water and a good
dinner, I retired to my private abode, a large hut
built Maori fashion, but with European door and
window, as I knew I should have to give audience to
some dozen chiefs of the Arawa tribe, who would call<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
on me to welcome my return and hear the news. It
did not take me long to prepare for their reception,
and getting the toy out of my kit, I slipped it up my
left sleeve, so that it was hidden. I then sat down
in a low camp-chair and awaited my victims, who
soon arrived, giving me their words of welcome as
they entered, and squatting down in a semicircle
in front of the fire, all of them as keen as mustard
to hear the news. They were a fine-looking lot of
old chaps, ten in number, and some of them almost
gigantic in size. Old Hori Haupapa must have
stood over seven foot high, when in his prime; and
the rest were all big men. Anxious as they were
to hear the news, still they were far too well-bred
to ask any questions, and, as I pretended to be in
very low spirits and sat speechless, heaving an
occasional deep sigh, they squatted there, conversing
in low whispers, with looks full of commiseration
for my unhappy state.</p>

<p>For a few minutes we sat quiet, then I made signs
to the girl who attended on us to hand round the
rum and tobacco: which she did. And after each
man had been served, letting go a dismal groan, I
said: &ldquo;Friends, I thank you for your words of welcome.
My heart is very dark. I have dreamed a
dream.&rdquo; Here I paused to let the poison work; for a
dream to a Maori audience is always a safe draw, and
the muttered grunts and ejaculations, passed round
with nudges, showed me they were quite ripe to believe
anything. So I continued: &ldquo;Yes, friends, last
night I dreamed a dream, and the interpretation of
that dream is hidden from me.&rdquo; Here I paused again,
and slipped the toy into my left hand, which rested on
my left knee, while I held their eyes with my own, so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
that, in the firelit whare, none of them noticed my
sleight of hand. Then I continued: &ldquo;I dreamed, O
chiefs of the Arawa, that we all sat, as we are doing
now, by this fire, when lo! out of my left hand crept
a ngaraka&rdquo; (green lizard). Here again I paused,
but so did not my hearers, for old Taupua, glancing
nervously at my left hand, at once spotted what he
thought to be a dreaded lizard. The grim old
warrior let go a howl of consternation and promptly
turned a back somersault, thereby drawing the
attention of all the others to the noxious reptile;
and in one moment these dignified old savages,
who would have faced without flinching the fire of
a battery of artillery sooner than have committed
a gaucherie, were trying to push and struggle through
the door, with no more regard to manners or manhood
than the ordinary well-dressed Englishman
displays who pushes ladies on one side while boarding
a tram.</p>

<p>The first one to reach the door was an ancient,
who did not understand the mechanism of a white
man&rsquo;s lock, so failed to open it; and in a moment
they were climbing over one another&rsquo;s backs, in
their frantic endeavours to escape until the end
of the whare gave way, and the big chiefs of the
Arawa tribe precipitated themselves, door and all,
into outer darkness, where they formed a confused
heap of writhing, howling humanity. At last they
struggled free, and each man made for his own hut,
all fully convinced that something dreadful was
going to happen and that the whole community was
past praying for. Nor did the panic end here; for
in a moment the tribe was roused up and, the awful
news being promulgated, in two flirts of a cat&rsquo;s tail,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
every man, woman and child had cleared out of the
kainga. Yes, those who had canoes took to them, and
those who had none used their legs, and used them
to some advantage, for in less time than it takes me
to write it the whole of that congregation of peaceful
natives had abandoned their happy homes and fled.</p>

<p>Well, after my first burst of laughter was over, I
began to count up the cost of my stupid joke, and at
once saw I was likely to have to pay dearly for my
fun. To commence with, my hut would have to be
rebuilt; but that was a trifle. What I had to fear
was the censure of the Government, as the Defence
Minister was an old Scotsman, without a particle of
fun in his whole corpus, so was not likely to view
the scatterment of his most pampered tribe with
equanimity, and visions of reasons in writing and
prosecutions danced before my eyes. It was clear
that the first thing to be done was to get the natives
to come back to their kainga; but how? I knew full
well they would not suffer me to approach within a
mile of any of them, and although I had some sterling
friends among the fighting chiefs, yet, if I could not
get speech with them, so as to explain matters to
them, their good will would be of no use to me.</p>

<p>Fortunately, among the men dwelling at Ohinimutu
was a Ngapuhi native, and I engaged him
to act as messenger; but, although he was a red-hot
Christian, nothing would persuade him to come
near, much less touch, the wretched toy. I, however,
induced this man to go over to Mokoia Island,
see the principal tribal tohunga, and get him to
come across and interview me. Fitting him out
with a gallon of rum and plenty of tobacco, I
despatched my Mercury and awaited his return in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
trepidation. On the morning of the second day
he reported himself, and informed me that the
tohunga awaited me, but that, as nothing would
induce the limb of Satan to land, I must go down
to the lake, and he would discourse with me from
his canoe. So I had to go to the lake and collogue
with the old sinner from the point of a jutting-out
cape. After I had tried to make him understand
the true state of affairs, I produced the toy; but
nothing I could say would induce him to believe
that it was composed of inanimate wood. No, he
could see it move, swore it was alive, and sternly
refused to touch it, or even come closer to me, so
that he could examine it. At last, happy thought,
I suggested I should burn it. To this he consented.
So, putting the unfortunate crocodile on the top of
a flat stone, I collected some dry sticks and, with
him watching every movement, constructed a
funeral pyre, and cremated the wretched toy to
ashes. Then he consented to land and came up
to my hut, where he went through many incantations
and gesticulations, although he avoided
touching or entering it. Presently he turned to
me and said: &ldquo;This and all it contains must be
at once burned. Have you removed anything from
it?&rdquo; I had not; though, expecting something of
this sort to happen, I had taken every care that my
servant should do so, and that absolutely nothing
of value remained within it; so, like a Radical
Minister, I only told half the truth. &ldquo;Set it on
fire,&rdquo; quoth he, and this I did with equanimity, as it
would only give the Maoris the trouble of building
me a better one, so that in a few minutes not a
vestige of my late mansion remained. As every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>thing
that had been contaminated by the penny
toy was now supposed to be destroyed, the old
tohunga consented to discuss terms of peace,
which consisted as follows:&mdash;first, that I should
hand over, privately, to the tohunga himself, one
gallon of rum, three pounds of tobacco and twenty-five
pounds of flour, the said tohunga guaranteeing
to at once dream a dream directing the natives to
rebuild my house, with great rapidity. Secondly,
that at the general tangi, to be held next day, on
the return of the natives, I was to provide ten
gallons of rum, twenty pounds of tobacco and half-a-ton
of flour, all of which was to be consumed
thereat. And lastly, should I on any future occasion
go to Napier, and discover any more instruments
of white man&rsquo;s devilry, I was to bring them to him,
when, with a little judicious management, we could
work many miracles to our mutual advantage.</p>

<p>All these terms having been agreed to, Satan&rsquo;s
representative among the Arawa departed, and
the next morning all his congregation, accompanied
by many of their country friends, returned, when
a big tangi with much feasting and dancing took
place; but even my very best friends looked askance
at me for a long time, while for some weeks the
majority of the women, girls and children would
fly from me as if I had the plague.</p>

<p>You must not think for a moment that this
avoidance was caused by ill will, or that the old
chiefs bore me any malice for the shameful trick
I had played them, or that I was fined the rum,
flour, etc., for the evil I had done. Not a bit of it.
I was mulct for my misfortune, not for my fault.
In their eyes no fault had been committed. If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
Moses himself had returned to tell them I had
played them a trick, they would not have believed
him. No; had they not seen the beast come out
of my hand at the very moment I was relating my
dream? Trick indeed, not much. They looked on
me as an awful example of misfortune, and therefore
as a fit and proper personage to be politely
robbed.</p>

<p>Yes, robbed. Had I been a Maori, not only myself
but all my family would have been robbed of every
single article we possessed in the world, in payment
for the affliction of bad luck that had fallen on me;
but as I was a white man this could not be done,
so I was fined. For is not this in accordance with
the ancient custom or law of Muru, which authorises
a man smitten by a sudden calamity to be plundered
of all he possesses? And what greater calamity was
possible to mortal man than to have an obscene
lizard grow out of his hand? Therefore I was fined.
As for trick, nonsense! What man dare make fun
of, or render ridiculous, the dignity and majesty of
the head chiefs of the Arawa tribe?</p>

<p>I think I may say a few more words on this
extraordinary law of muru&mdash;a law that Europeans
regarded with laughter and contempt; yet it worked
very well among the natives, and should any family
have met with misfortune and the law not have
been put in force against them, they would have
considered themselves not only slighted, but insulted.
It also, among others, contained one
salient good quality, as it caused all personal portable
property constantly to change hands, for the
family that was plundered one day would, in the
ordinary course of events, rob some other family<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
a few days afterwards, so that a canoe, blanket or
any household utensil might pass through many
hands and, if not worn out during its transits, might
at last return to its original possessor. Yet to a
white man it did seem funny that a party of natives
<i>en route</i> to visit another family, and whose canoe
should be capsized when landing, were not only
robbed of their canoe, but that the unlucky ones
would have considered themselves insulted had not
their friends immediately annexed it.</p>

<p>I remember well that once, while on a journey
to visit a pah, accompanied by a chief of some
importance, in fact he was a native assessor&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
a sort of Maori J.P. appointed by Government&mdash;a
very queer illustration of the law of muru cropped
up.</p>

<p>We were to inquire into some trivial case, the
defendant being the son of the chief of the place,
and the utmost penalty not more than five shillings.
Just as we reached the pah my companion, who
was riding a fine, high-spirited horse, was bucked
off, and while in the act of rising received a severe
kick on the croup. He was picked up with much
solicitude, all the natives condoling with him. The
case was tried and settled, the defendant being
mulct two shillings and sixpence, and next day,
when about to depart, the horses being brought
to the gate of the pah, my companion&rsquo;s horse was
not forthcoming. At once I demanded the reasons
why, and was informed it had been annexed as
muru, for throwing and kicking my unfortunate
friend, who at once acquiesced in the judgment
and thanked the chief of the pah for his courtesy
in paying him such an honour.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>Again I was on a visit to a pah situated close
to the mouth of a river, on the other side of which
was another pah. One day my hosts started out
to shoot a huge seine net, and of course the whole
population turned out to assist or give advice.
The noise, as everyone yelled at the top of his
or her gamut, was deafening. However, two large
canoes eventually got away with the net on board,
and after taking a bold sweep returned to shore
and landed the sea end. Immediately all hands,
redoubling their yells, tailed on to the hauling
ropes and pulled and howled with all their might.
Just as the bag of the net came in view, a huge
shark, that had been encompassed in its toils, made
a bold dash, broke the net and escaped, letting out,
at the same time, many large fish. The excited
and disappointed natives were just dragging the
net and the still great remainder of the catch up
on to the sand, when their neighbours, apprised by
the yells that something unfortunate had occurred,
dashed across the river in their canoes, and after
a sham resistance of a few minutes swept up and
carried off all the remaining fish. They might
also have confiscated the net, but did not, an old
chief confiding to me that the other side of the
river was full of rocks, and not suitable for seine
netting; moreover, the net was broken and would
require repairing. Such was the law of muru.</p>

<p>Of course to yarn about New Zealand without
saying anything about the custom of Tapu would
be on all fours with yarning about Rome and not
mentioning the Pope. So here goes for a few
remarks about the ancient but very confusing
custom of tapu.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>Anything animate or inanimate could be rendered
tapu by the will, or even touch, of a man who was
tapu himself. Tapu might also render a thing so
sacred, or might render it so unclean, that to touch
that thing would constitute an act of unpardonable
sacrilege, or cause the toucher to be looked upon
as so defiled as to be ostracised by the whole
community, although the act was done innocently
and in ignorance.</p>

<p>To break a tapu was looked upon, by the
superstitious natives, as a direct challenge to the
greatly dreaded spiritual powers, and was certain
to bring swift and awful punishment.</p>

<p>A big chief was tapu, and if he went to war the
essence of tapu became doubly distilled, so much
so that he could not feed himself, nor even touch
food with his hands. Nor could he even touch
a cup or utensil that did not actually belong to
himself, for if he did so, the article he used at once
became so tapu that no one else could use it;
consequently it became either his personal property,
or had to be destroyed. This in a country where
there were neither shops nor manufactories was
an impossibility, so that at meal-time a chief had
to eat apart, and be fed by either a girl or slave.
Truly the sublime approached the ridiculous, to see
a grim, tattooed old warrior squatting down, with
a small girl throwing morsels of food into his
mouth, or with his head thrown back, and his jaws
extended to their full width, receiving a stream of
water, poured down his throat, from the spout of
an ancient tea-kettle. Even an ordinary warrior,
not being a slave, lost his back when on the warpath&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
his back became so tapu that he could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
carry nothing, much less provisions, on it; and this
was also very inconvenient when having to march
through a rough, bushed country, without waggons
or pack-horses. Food could even become tapu,
especially that which remained from the portion
served out for the use of the chief, even though
no part of his body had touched it; and there is
a well-authenticated case, that on one occasion a
slave, being on the warpath, found some food and
ate it. No sooner had he done so than he was
informed it was the remains of the dinner of the
fighting chief. This news so horrified the poor
superstitious wretch that he was at once taken
ill with sharp internal pains, and died.</p>

<p>The Maoris always made their plantations in
the bush, frequently at a considerable distance from
their kaingas, and these, after the potatoes had
been planted, would only be occasionally visited by
their owners, who, to protect them, would get the
chief or tohunga to tapu the plantation; and this
being done, the produce would be quite safe from
the depredations of others.</p>

<p>About the year 1870 some six brace of pheasants
were turned loose in the Waikato district, and the
principal chief put his tapu on them for seven
years. These birds increased and throve in a
manner truly wonderful. Not a Maori dare touch
one, although long before the period of protection
had expired the birds had not only spread all over
the Waikato district, but also over all the adjoining
ones. And they carried their protection with them,
for notwithstanding the fact that they had become
somewhat of a nuisance to the Arawa tribe, who
were not in any way subordinate to the Waikato<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
chief, yet they respected his tapu, and would have
starved sooner than eaten them.</p>

<p>It was by making use of this tapu that the wonderful
head of game and fish at present in New Zealand
has been reared and acclimatised.</p>

<p>Should a chief die within his whare, that hut
and everything it contained at once became tapu
and was lost to use; for as soon as his body had
been removed, the door was at once blocked up,
and the hut with its contents allowed to moulder
away, no one daring to touch, much less remove,
one single article. Tapu, therefore, in a manner
of speaking, was the antipoise of the law of muru,
for if the enforcement of the latter rendered the
portable property of an individual or tribe precarious,
yet tapu made his title indissoluble; so the
two laws or customs got on very well together, and
may exist to the present day.</p>

<p>I cannot leave my friends the Maoris without
speaking about their awful cruelty in torturing and
killing their prisoners, and in the foul massacres of
helpless women and children.</p>

<p>Yet even in this there may be something said in
their favour, especially should you compare them,
savages as they were, with the human monsters
that every Christian European country has produced,
when they would be found no more cruel
or bloodthirsty.</p>

<p>Now I don&rsquo;t want to draw parallels in history,
but it rather disgusts me to hear Alva, Tilly, Nana
Sahib, or even Te Kooti, run down, while such a
cold-blooded villain as Cromwell is extolled.</p>

<p>I was taught as a schoolboy to regard Tilly
and Alva as the incarnations of Satan; I suppose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
because they made it sultry for Protestants; but
it was not pointed out to me that at the very same
time Alva and his Spanish troops were making
it hot for Lutherans in the Netherlands, the
English troops of Protestant Queen Bess were
perpetrating infinitely worse brutalities on the
helpless Irish, while the fiendish cruelties of Tilly&rsquo;s
wild Croats and Pandours, at the sack of
Magdeburg, were equalled, if not surpassed, at
Drogheda, by Oliver Cromwell and his canting
hypocritical Puritans.</p>

<p>I am myself an Irishman, a Protestant, a Unionist
and an Imperialist, just as ready to fight for our
King and Flag as ever I was during the forty
years I passed on the Colonial frontiers, but I can
blame none of my countrymen for the hatred they
feel towards England, provided they fight like men
and eschew all cowardly, underhand, secret societies;
and I am convinced it will require many centuries
to roll past before the recollection of the Penal
Laws and the foul, savage treachery of past English
rule is obliterated, while the curse of Cromwell will
remain for ever. Nana Sahib and Te Kooti did
not, combined, kill as many helpless women and
children as either Alva, Tilly or Cromwell; yet,
as they killed all they could, they cannot be
blamed for that, and I have no doubt that on their
arrival in Hades they were assigned just as
honourable entertainment and particular attentions
as the aristocratic fiend, the priestly murderer or
the Puritan cut-throat.</p>

<p>It must also be remembered that the atrocities
committed by Te Kooti and his fanatical followers
might be blamed upon the fiendish faith they had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
adopted and had never been practised by the
Maoris during the previous six years of the war,
also that they were more or less fighting in defence
of their country against invaders. Again, Te Kooti
had been the victim of gross injustice, at the hands
of the Colonial Government, insomuch as he had
been transported without trial, and that the
evidence against him was not only insufficient, but
was also of such a nature that the law officers of
the Crown could find no excuse even to bring him
to a trial, so that many of his brutalities were
prompted by a desire for utu, a custom universally
practised by the Maoris.</p>

<p>Please don&rsquo;t think I have written the above for the
purpose of deifying England&rsquo;s enemy, or to slander
my own countrymen like a Radical Little Englander,
for I would have, at any time, blown the roof off Te
Kooti&rsquo;s head, or that of one of his followers, with as
little compunction as I have since shot a mangy
jackal; but I have written it simply to show that, if
savage New Zealand produced one fiend, in the
shape of Te Kooti, Christian England produced a
worse one in the shape of that sanctimonious
hypocrite, Oliver Cromwell, and that therefore we
should not endanger our own glass by throwing
stones.</p>

<p>I alluded just now to the custom of utu,
which means payment or revenge, and is very
similar to the law of the Jews, that laid down the
maxim of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth&mdash;an
axiom which the Maoris believe in thoroughly.</p>

<p>It was the practice of this custom that led to
many of the sanguinary combats and massacres
that took place between the armed traders and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
natives during the first half of the past century.
These traders visited New Zealand and exchanged
muskets, powder, ironware, etc., for flax, whale
oil, curios and men&rsquo;s heads. They were a hard-fisted,
lawless crowd, who, in their brigs or
schooners, well armed with musket, pike and
carronade, would anchor in one of the splendid
natural harbours and begin their traffic with the
haughty, warlike savages.</p>

<p>Business carried on between such men as these
often brought about a row, which a musket shot
or a slash from cutlass or tomahawk would not
improve, and the ship would then sail away, after
most likely the killing or wounding of some natives.
The remembrance of the blood spilt would be
treasured by the Maoris, and the next trader who
visited that place would have to pay for the evil
deeds of the previous visitor. Now the Maori
looked on all white men as belonging to the same
tribe, and the custom of utu allowed any man
injured by an individual to wreak his vengeance
upon any member of the said individual&rsquo;s tribe,
provided his particular enemy were absent. In
this he was backed up by all the members of his
own tribe, especially if blood had been drawn;
for tribal blood must be paid for with blood,
and no Sicilian clan ever carried out a vendetta
more thoroughly than a Maori hapu. This being
so, the Maoris eagerly looked for the next vessel,
to take their blood payment for the blood spilt.</p>

<p>Knowing full well that their canoes and spears
were no match for the well-armed ship, they would
bide their time and have recourse to treachery.
The white men would be received with apparent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
good will, and, if foolish enough, might be lulled
into a mistaken sense of security. This being
done, the majority of the crew would be enticed
ashore, where, taken off their guard, or separated,
they would be attacked, killed and eaten, while the
ship, weakened by the loss of so many men, was
sometimes boarded and captured, the natives
thereby obtaining utu for the original injury done
them.</p>

<p>Maoris were very punctilious about the honour
of their tribes and ancestors, this being carried
to an extent almost ludicrous. <i>Par exemple</i>, a
year or two before I left New Zealand an old
woman belonging to one tribe was planting
potatoes, and as she shoved each tuber into the
ground she called it by the name of one of the
principal living chiefs or dead heroes of an adjoining
tribe. This came to the ears of the said tribe,
who immediately prepared for war, despatching an
ultimatum that, unless the plantation and all the
spuds it contained were at once destroyed, they
would attack their insulting neighbours. The
<i>casus belli</i> must seem very absurd to a white man;
but it was different to the offended tribe, as when,
in the course of events, the murphies became ready
for the pot, the scandalous old dame would be
able to declare that she was not only devouring
their living chiefs, but that, vampire-like, she was
feeding upon their defunct ones.</p>

<p>I mentioned that the Maoris performed many
splendid acts of courage in getting away their
wounded and even their dead. This was done not
only for love or comradeship, but to prevent the
enemy from using their flesh in lieu of butcher<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>&rsquo;s
meat, and also to save their bones being turned
into useful and ornamental articles by their
opponents.</p>

<p>For instance, let us suppose that during some
ancient war, the Waikato tribe fighting against the
Taranaki, the former should have killed and
captured the body of a great war chief whom we
will call Te Rawa. The flesh of the dead man, in
the first place, would be eaten&mdash;a great indignity&mdash;but
that would not be the end of him, for the bones
would be preserved, and turned into fish-hooks,
flutes and ornaments, the teeth strung nicely on
flax, making a necklace; and it was not pleasant for
the victim&rsquo;s descendants to hear that their revered
though unfortunate ancestor was still furnishing
food and bijouterie for the offspring of his slayer.</p>

<p>Now all the aforementioned useful articles were
called by the name of the man they had, in the
first place, belonged to&mdash;in this case Te Rawa.
The owner of the fish-hook could boast that he
was still eating Te Rawa, as he would call all the
fish caught by that special hook Te Rawa. Then,
pointing to the necklace, he might brag he was
wearing Te Rawa, and when inclined for music
he would tootle on his flute and proudly declare
he was playing Te Rawa; so that the unfortunate
descendants of the poor old defunct, whenever
they heard of this, would have to blush under their
tattooed skins at the very name of their much-deplored
ancestor.</p>

<p>It was therefore a most sacred duty to rescue
a dead or wounded comrade from the enemy, even
when fighting against the white men; for although
the natives well knew that we did not use their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
defunct relatives for rations, nor turn them into
musical instruments, yet it had become so strong
a custom among themselves to guard against such
a possible catastrophe, that they still practised it
although unnecessarily.</p>

<p>I must revert once more to the custom of utu
so as to point out the fair-mindedness of the natives
should this law be used against themselves. Let
me give you just one instance.</p>

<p>The circumstance took place after the capture
of Ngatapa. Some 130 Hau Haus had been taken
prisoners, these being shot out of hand and their
bodies thrown over a precipice; but six or eight
of them remained alive, in our hands, as it was
not certain they had participated in the Poverty
Bay massacre. They were confined in a hut
awaiting trial and, as all the murdered people were
dead, it was a moot point whether these fellows
would not get off for want of evidence. One of
the men, however, whose relations had been
murdered, determined that they should not slip
through the clumsy fingers of the law, as alas so
many of the blood-stained villains had succeeded
in doing. He volunteered to act as one of the
guard round the hut and, borrowing another revolver
from a mate, he took the first opportunity to enter
the hut and deliberately blew out the brains of all
the inmates.</p>

<p>This act of summary justice was fully approved
of by the Maoris, as it bore out the custom of utu;
for if the defunct Hau Haus had not murdered
the man&rsquo;s family themselves, yet their tribes had
done so; and they considered it a square deal, as
blood had been paid for by blood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>I could yarn on about these queer people for
hours and tell you of plenty of other quaint customs,
such as their wakes, marriages, etc., also about their
industry and other qualities, good and bad, for, faith!
they have them mixed like all other people. But if
you have followed and appreciated my first attempt
it will encourage me to write more of my humble
experiences on the frontiers of the Empire with the
old Lost Legion I love so well.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<small>HOW MATENE FAILED TO CONVERT THE LOWER
WANGANUI</small></h2>


<p>It was in April 1864 that Te Ua, the crazy founder
of the Pai Marire faith, despatched his apostle and
prophet, Matene Rangitanira, to convert the tribes
of the Wanganui River to the new religion.</p>

<p>Now these tribes were divided into two sections,
who, although closely connected by blood, lived
under separate chiefs, and notwithstanding the fact
that they were allied for mutual support against
outsiders still, like many European families, harboured
jealousies among themselves. There was
also this difference between them: the Lower River
tribes had from the first always been friendly
disposed towards the settlers, or at all events had
tolerated them, while the Upper River natives
detested the white man, although the latter had
in no way encroached on them, nor had they ever
had much to do with them, as their country was
at a considerable distance from the English settlements,
the only means of communication being
the river.</p>

<p>The Upper River natives were also, at this time,
greatly enraged against the white man and desirous
of utu (revenge), on account of the death of one
of their principal chiefs, who had been killed the
previous year, together with thirty-six of his men,
at the storming of Kotikara. Matene, who was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
member of the Wanganui tribes, arrived in April
1864, accompanied by a party of Taranaki fanatics,
at Pipiriki, an important native village situated on
the upper waters of the Wanganui River, and began
his mission.</p>

<p>At this place Mr Booth, the resident magistrate
for the district, dwelt, and although at the moment
he was absent in the township of Wanganui his
wife and family, together with his brother and his
family, were there. Mr Booth was a most popular
official with the Maoris, and it is quite possible
that, had he been at his post, he might have been
able to put a stop to the apostle&rsquo;s preaching before
it became too late; but unfortunately he was absent
on duty and was much delayed during his return
journey by the paucity of water in the river, so that
it was the end of the month before he reached
Pipiriki, and the evil teaching had taken a firm hold
on the natives.</p>

<p>Matene made such good use of Mr Booth&rsquo;s
absence that in a few days he had converted
the great majority of the Upper River natives
and had erected a Niu (Hau Hau worship pole), on
which Captain Lloyd&rsquo;s head was suspended, and
the tribe&rsquo;s men and women, mad with fanaticism,
danced furiously round it. During Mr Booth&rsquo;s
slow progress up the river the reports he received
at every village he passed grew worse and worse,
while at Hiruharama the chiefs begged him not
to go on, as they warned him that the people
farther up had joined the Hau Haus and were all
stark raving mad. Mr Booth, however, was grit
right through; his brother and their families were
in direful danger and he considered it to be his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
duty, both as a relation and also as an official, to
risk everything in trying to save them. He therefore
pushed on, trusting to his great influence and
friendship with the principal chiefs and tribes to
pull him through, so as to enable him to save his
brother and their respective families.</p>

<p>On his reaching the landing-place at Pipiriki
he immediately saw that whatever influence and
friendship he may have, at one time, held over
the people was a thing of the past, as, instead of
the shouts and songs of welcome by the women,
and the gladful rush of young warriors to haul his
canoe up the bank so that he could land dryshod,
all the population lined the high river bank, making
hideous grimaces at him and howling like a lot
of wild beasts.</p>

<p>Giving up all hope and expecting immediate
death, Mr Booth sat quietly in his canoe waiting
to receive it with the calm courage of a British
pioneer, when suddenly a young but important
chief, Hori Patene by name, forced his way through
the crowd of yelling savages and, jumping into the
canoe, started to tangi (shed tears of welcome) and
rubbed noses with him. When this ceremony was
over Hori persuaded Mr Booth to go home, and
although he fully expected to be cut to pieces
every yard of the road, still accompanied and
protected by the gallant Hori, he succeeded in
reaching his house, where he found his wife and
children more than half dead with horror and fear,
expecting to be tortured and brutally murdered
every minute. No sooner had Mr Booth reached
his house than Hori started off and crossed the
river, returning with Mr Booth&rsquo;s brother and his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
family, so that all the whites might be together,
under his (Hori&rsquo;s) protection, or, if the worst came
to the worst, they could all die in company.</p>

</div>

<p>It was now sunset and the Hau Haus began
their devotions, and, as the Niu had been erected
in front of Mr Booth&rsquo;s house, the unfortunate
inmates could not help seeing the awful cantrips
nor hearing the foul incantations. Huge fires were
lit, and by their light hundreds of men and women,
in parties of about fifty at a time, danced round
the pole on which hung poor Captain Lloyd&rsquo;s
head. Starting slowly and with low-pitched but
deep voices they began to chant the mystic words,
Hau Hau Pai Marire, while circling round the
ring; but gradually, as the spirit got hold of them,
they put on the pace until, like a mob of drunken
demoniacs, they leaped, stamped and cavorted round
the Niu with foul, indecent gestures, grimaces and
contortions of body, far beyond the conception of
an ordinary human being, while the mystic words
were howled out at the top of their gamuts, so that
they resembled a hideous phantasmagoria such as
might be seen by a lunatic suffering from a bad
dose of d.t.</p>

<p>Hideous and disgusting as the contortions of the
men were, those of the women were worse; for no
sooner had the spirit entered into them than in
their mad gyrations they leaped at the suspended
head, trying, with their teeth, to bite and worry
the smoke-dried flesh and hair of the unfortunate
officer; and this they continued to do until at length,
foaming at the mouth and worn out with their crazy
frenzy, they either staggered from the ring or fell
in convulsions on the ground, to be dragged away by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
the next batch of worshippers who were anxiously
awaiting their turn. And this awful pandemonium
went on all through the night. Just think, my
home-staying countrymen and women, who sleep
in peace under the guardianship of our splendid
police, what must have been the feelings of those
English ladies and men who, with their helpless
children, had to witness such scenes, knowing and
fully expecting, as they did, that at any moment
they might be dragged out and, after they had all
been subjected to prolonged torture, should then
be brutally murdered, with every barbarity and
indignity that fiends could invent or devils could
inflict.</p>

<p>During the night a council was held and Mr
Booth could hear the Taranaki men who had
accompanied Matene urging the Wanganui to
torture and kill himself and family. Nor did the
latter seem to want such urging, as of all his
whilom friends only Hori and one other man spoke
on his behalf, contesting right manfully that the
honour of the Upper River tribes would be for ever
disgraced should the white people not be allowed
to depart in safety, as they were tribal guests. For
two more days and another night the unfortunate
whites were kept in suspense, Hori and a few other
young chiefs, whom he had persuaded to join him,
standing between the would-be murderers and their
prey. And these noble young savages eventually
saved them.</p>

<p>It was near sunset on the last of these days, and
after a very stormy meeting had been held, that
Hori rushed into Mr Booth&rsquo;s house, saying: &ldquo;At
last they have consented to let you go. Come at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
once; leave all your property to me; for they
may change their minds any moment.&rdquo; Immediately
they jumped up and followed him down
to the canoe landing-place. <i>En route</i> they had to
pass through a swarm of armed Hau Haus who
had lined the high river bank, and while doing so
Mr Booth heard some of them say: &ldquo;Wait till they
get into the canoe and then we will fire a volley so
as to shoot them down in a heap.&rdquo; Hori overheard
the same remarks and said to Mr Booth:
&ldquo;Take no notice of them. Go slowly until you are
out of sight; I and my friends will keep in the line
of fire between you and the Hau Haus.&rdquo; This the
gallant young fellow did, and, as the murderous
brutes dare not run the risk of killing a Wanganui
chief, Mr Booth and his party paddled out of shot
and reached the township of Wanganui safely the
following night.</p>

<p>The above yarn is a true though short narrative
of one of the numerous attempts made by chivalrous
Maoris to protect helpless white men from the blind,
ferocious fanaticism of Te Ua&rsquo;s prophets. Alas! it
was one of the very few successful ones, though many
brave natives lost their lives and suffered torture
rather than give information to the Hau Haus as
to the whereabouts of white fugitives. Surely their
names and actions should be remembered.</p>

<p>Immediately after Mr Booth&rsquo;s escape Matene
and the Taranaki Hau Haus persuaded the tribes
of the Upper Wanganui to attack, with the intention
of utterly destroying, the white settlers and thriving
township of Wanganui, situated close to the mouth
of the river, and at once all hands turned to, to
prepare their war canoes for that purpose. Before,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
however, starting on this expedition, they sent
ambassadors to their relations, the Lower River
natives, so as to inform them of their purpose, and
ask for their co-operation; announcing at the same
time that, should their relations not care to join
in and make a family party of the expedition, they
(the Upper River natives) would still carry out their
programme&mdash;viz. descend the river and wipe out
every white man, woman and child in the district!</p>

<p>These emissaries, arriving at Hiruharama, a
village that may be called the frontier post of the
river tribes, delivered their cheeky message, which
to the recipients was intolerable, as the Lower
River tribes claimed the right-of-way on the river
to the westward of Hiruharama, and although it had
been frequently attempted in times past, no war
party had ever, up to date, succeeded in forcing a
passage, and none ever should succeed, so long as
a Lower River native warrior could handle musket
or swing tomahawk. This being the well-known
determination of the Lower River tribes, the chiefs
at Hiruharama returned an evasive answer to the
Hau Haus, at the same time despatching a fast
canoe downstream, so as to warn all their friends
of the threatened eruption and give the tip to the
white men of their imminent danger. Then, not
being in sufficient strength to withstand the brunt
of the encounter, the village was immediately
abandoned, all the inhabitants retiring downstream,
collecting <i>en route</i> the people belonging to the
pahs Kanaeroa and Tawhitinui; but on reaching
Ranana they halted, being joined at that place by
the bulk of the warriors of the Lower River. Close
to Ranana was the island of Moutoa, a classic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
battle-ground, every square yard of which had been
drenched with blood, shed in old-time wars, and on
this island they determined, should their relations
attempt to carry out their threats and try to force
their way down the river, to resist them to the last
gasp. In the meantime the Hau Haus, uncertain
as to what sort of reception they would receive,
were cautiously descending the river, and as they
found every village deserted they halted at and
occupied Tawhitinui, which was situated some two
miles above Ranana and on the other bank, and
from this place opened negotiations with their
relations.</p>

<p>The last few days had been passed by the white
population in consternation almost amounting to
despair. The outlying farmers and settlers,
abandoning homes, stock and everything they
owned, rushed into town, where each man anxiously
asked his friends: &ldquo;Can we trust the Lower River
natives?&rdquo; &ldquo;Will they become converted and join
the Hau Haus?&rdquo; &ldquo;If so, what then?&rdquo; True, they
possessed one great factor in their favour, and that
was the firm and undeviating friendship of old
Hori Kingi Te Anaua (the paramount chief of the
Lower Waikato), whose name should be remembered
and treasured by every white man, woman and
child on the west coast of New Zealand. For
when the first settlers landed at Wanganui, Hori,
then the most renowned warrior on the coast, had
taken their leader by the hand, and declared himself
to be the friend and protector of the white
man, and this promise the pagan cannibal warrior
carried out both in letter and spirit till the day of
his death. But then, alas! Hori by this time was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
very old man, and although the glamour of his great
deeds enveloped the aged chief like a halo, and his
people regarded him as a being something more
than human; still, taking into consideration the
astonishing way the crazy Pai Marire faith had
been accepted by the Upper River natives as well as
by many other tribes, it was very doubtful whether
old Hori would be able to restrain them at such a
crisis. Moreover, all the Lower Wanganui natives
were strong supporters of the Maori King movement,
and many of their important sub-chiefs,
especially Mete Kingi Te Anaua, a chief only
second to Hori in influence, hated the white men;
so that the settlers may well be pardoned for their
consternation; as, in case the Lower River natives
saw fit to join their relations and become Hau
Haus, even should they (the settlers) successfully
repulse the combined native attack, and save their
own lives, still the township and all the outlying
farms must go up in smoke. They therefore made
what preparations they could for defence and
anxiously waited the termination of the native
runanga (meeting). As I have previously stated,
the Lower River tribes had massed at Ranana, the
Hau Haus occupying the adjacent pah Tawhitinui,
and on 13th May 1864 the prophet Matene, with
a numerous deputation of his newly made converts,
paddled over to Ranana to open negotiations.</p>

<p>Now it is quite possible, nay, even probable, that
had Matene opened the proceedings of the runanga
with prayer and incantations, as does the British
House of Parliament, he would have succeeded in
converting the opposition party and so have gained
his nefarious ends; but this he did not do, as no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
sooner had the deputation been announced than
Matene issued this insolent ultimatum&mdash;viz. that
they (the Hau Haus) were determined to descend
the river, peacefully if allowed to do so, but otherwise
would win through by force. Whoop, hullabaloo,
that ultimatum, short as it was, upset the
fat into the fire and brought Haimona, chief of the
Ngatipa-Moana and a mighty fighting man before
the Lord, on to his feet, who replied: &ldquo;Och it&rsquo;s force
the river ye&rsquo;ll be after, is it? Well, divil a drop of
it ye&rsquo;ll mix wid yer whisky beyand the island of
Moutoa; mind yez that, ye black-advised, audacious
Hau Haus; but av it&rsquo;s a fight ye want, sure there&rsquo;s
that same island Moutoa, that&rsquo;s moighty convanient,
and maybe ye&rsquo;ll not want to go furder whin we&rsquo;ve
finished wid ye; so come on now, M&rsquo;Matene, Esq.,
an trid on the tail of me mat, ye ruddy heretic, or get
back to the ould Te Ua, an&rsquo; may the cuss of Cromel
rest on him and his Pai Marire monkey tricks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, as I am trying to be a truthful narrator,
I am bound to confess that the above is not
a verbatim report of the oration spoken by
Haimona, although the sentiments expressed in it
are exactly similar and both contained a direct
challenge; which challenge was immediately
accepted, and as there was nothing further to
squabble about, both parties went into committee to
amicably discuss the coming fight, settle the details
and sign the articles, which were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That a fight should take place the following day
on the island of Moutoa. 2. That the freedom of
the right of road on the river should be the stake.
3. Seeing that the combatants were closely connected
by blood relationship as well as by alliance,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
and that it would be bad policy to weaken the
fighting strength of the combined Wanganui tribes
by indiscriminate slaughter, it was therefore agreed
that only 100 men a side should take part in the
combat. 4. That as the Lower River natives were
the owners of the island, they should land on the
lower end before daylight. That the Hau Haus
should land at the top end at daylight and that
their disembarkation should be unopposed. 5. That
both sides bound themselves to refrain from all
ambuscades, tricks or trickery, but were to meet
and fairly fight it out to the bitter end.</p>

<p>Next morning at grey dawn 100 picked men,
of the Lower River tribes, were ferried over to
Moutoa, landed and arranged themselves in order
of battle, divided into two companies of equal
strength, and each company was told off into three
subdivisions, these being led by renowned warriors.
The leading company or van was commanded by
Tamehana Te Aewa, who was also C.O. of the
whole outfit, who had under him Hemi Napi as
leader of the right subdivision, Riwai Tawhitorangi
leader of the centre and Kereti of the left. The
supporting company was commanded by Haimona,
but, through an error in tactics, it had been located
200 yards in rear of the van, a distance far
too great for men armed with double-barrelled
guns to render effective aid; and this error nearly
caused disaster. To the tick of time the Hau Haus
disembarked at the top end of the island but, alas!
their pristine chivalry had been already tainted by
their infernal religion, as they landed 130 men
instead of the stipulated number, which was not
cricket. They had also a powerful moral factor in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
their favour&mdash;viz. they (the Hau Haus) believed
themselves to be invulnerable, while most of their
opponents more than half believed the same thing,
so that, notwithstanding their splendid courage and
determination, very many of the latter considered
themselves to be hopelessly handicapped in having
to fight against men who were aided by angels.
This nervousness must have increased as Tamehana
led the leading company on to the attack, for when
within thirty yards of the Hau Haus the centre and
left subdivisions fired a volley, of which every
bullet flew wide, not one single Hau Hau being
hurt; of course this vile shooting had the effect
of confirming the fears of the Lower River natives
and exhilarating their opponents.</p>

<p>The latter made haste to return the volley, and just
as they did so a Roman Catholic lay brother rushed
in between the combatants, exhorting them to terminate
this fratricidal strife. Poor devil, he met with
the end that many men who interfere with family jars
do meet with, as the volley finished him off before
he could finish his first argument; and it has often
been a matter of speculation to me as to whether
he was a martyr or only an interfering busybody.
This same volley also was a most disastrous one
for the Lower River natives: Riwai and Kereti with
many of their men fell dead, while the survivors of
their own subdivisions, disheartened by the loss
of their leaders, and now fully convinced of the
invulnerability of the Hau Haus, broke their ranks
and fell back in disorder. Hemi Nape and his
men, however, refused to fly and in a few moments
proved that at all events some of the Hau Haus were
far from being immortal, much less invulnerable.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>Fine fighters Hemi Nape and his boys, were and
well they bore themselves, but alas! how could they,
less than twenty in number, withstand such overwhelming
odds?&mdash;so that though they fought like
fiends incarnate still they were driven back and
must have been quickly wiped out. Help, however,
was at hand, for suddenly old Tamehana Te Aewa,
with the roar of a wild bull, threw himself into the
vortex of the combat and, begorra! he made things
lively. You see, when the centre and left subdivisions
gave way he tried to rally them, but
failing to do so he returned alone to the fight, so
as to throw in his lot with the lads who scorned to
fly. Just at the moment he arrived Hemi had
ordered his men to take cover, but that did not
suit Tamehana, who charged the Hau Haus like a
whirlwind and killed two of them with a clean right
and left; then, throwing away his empty gun, he
picked up a spear dropped by one of the dead
men and drove it through a third one&rsquo;s body,
grabbing, as the dying man fell, his gun and
tomahawk. The gun was unfortunately not loaded,
but he made use of it by braining a fourth man
with the butt and then sank the blade of the
tomahawk so deep into a fifth man&rsquo;s skull that as
he tried to wrench it out the tough handle went
to splinters. Immediately he seized his last victim&rsquo;s
gun and was about to use it when a bullet struck
him in the arm, and he had just time to shoot the
man who had wounded him when another smashed
his right knee to pieces and put a termination to
his day&rsquo;s sport. When he fell the Hau Haus made
a rush to finish him off, which rush was met by a
counter-charge of Hemi Nape&rsquo;s men, who, although<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
they were all wounded, determined to die rather
than allow old Tamehana to be killed or captured.
Led by Marino, Hemi&rsquo;s son, for Hemi himself had
been shot dead a moment before, they threw
themselves on the Hau Haus and made such a
determined stand that it gave time to Haimona
with his supporting company to come into action.</p>

<p>This grim old warrior had been originally posted
too far in rear of the van and had lost some time
in rallying the fugitives, whom he tongue-lashed
out of their cowardly nervousness, his endeavours
being helped by the scornful yells and entreaties
of the men and women spectators, who, mad with
excitement, watched the apparently lost battle from
the bank of the river. Then promptly adding the
whilom runaways to his own party, he rapidly
advanced to make his effort. There was no fear
now of the late fugitives turning tail again, for nigh
crazy with shame and contrition, they would far
sooner face a thousand deaths than be branded as
cowards through the length and breadth of New
Zealand.</p>

<p>Deflecting his advance to the right, he cleared
the expiring struggle in which the remnant of
Hemi&rsquo;s men were still dying hard, and then by
a quick change of front to the left he outflanked
the Hau Haus and at close quarters poured in two
death-dealing volleys that decimated the fanatics.
Then without a moment&rsquo;s delay &ldquo;out tomahawks&rdquo;
was the order and, led by Haimona himself, the new-comers
rushed madly into the fray. Immediately
the aspect of the combat changed. Up to this time
the Hau Haus had had much the best of it, but now
fickle Fortune turned her back upon them and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
old Tamehana&rsquo;s bearsark rush, together with the
glorious stand made by Hemi Nape&rsquo;s men, were
to reap their reward; as from the moment
Haimona&rsquo;s party took a hand in the game the
Upper River natives had to fight, not for conquest,
but for their lives. The volleys they had received
had killed several important chiefs and many men,
while the furious charge of Haimona&rsquo;s party on
their left flank all but routed them; still they were
Maori warriors, as brave as any men on earth,
and although broken and confused they turned
to meet the attack with the greatest courage.</p>

<p>Now began the last phase of a fight that Homer
himself would have loved to sing about. Howling
for blood, Haimona&rsquo;s men rushed into hand-to-hand
combat. Both sides had discarded their guns,
both sides ceased from yelling as they came chest
to chest, but the tomahawks gave out a sharp click,
as they clashed against one another in the air, that
provided the alto part to the sickening scrunch
of the inflicting wound, the guttural grunt of the
wounder and the sobbing groan of the wounded.
Faith! it was a fine fight. The impetuosity of the
desperate charge bore the Hau Haus backwards,
and in spite of their furious efforts they were forced
to continue the retrograde movement, for the Lower
River Maoris, fighting as they were with their
tribesmen and women looking on, outdid their best,
while the men who had previously fled, madly
anxious to obliterate their shame, and who, careless
of wounds and death, only strove to kill, fought like
demons. The Hau Haus were therefore steadily
driven back, and as the bloody tussle continued
they at last reached the shore of the island, when,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
unable to make a stand, or retire farther, those
that remained on their feet were forced to plunge
into the rapid current and attempt to escape by
swimming. Of these but few reached the opposite
bank, and of those who were lucky enough to do
so twenty were captured by Mete Kingi, who, with
350 Lower River warriors, had watched the fight.</p>

<p>The end of the prophet Matene brought the whole
show to a tragical finale. He had fought bravely
through the fight; for, as it is only right to give the
devil his due, I may here state that all of Te Ua&rsquo;s
prophets were game to lead any cracked-brained
exploit they might have persuaded their misguided
disciples to undertake, and consequently vacancies
frequently occurred in the apostolic ranks. Well,
Matene was still alive when the remnant of his
men were forced into the river, so he had to frog
it with them, and was swimming away for all he
was worth when the eagle eye of Haimona spotted
him. The chief turned to his aide-de-camp, Te
Moro, and handed him his bone mere (a short
battle-axe made out of whalebone and greatly
used by the natives before the introduction of steel-bladed
tomahawks), at the same time pointing out
the fugitive and remarking: &ldquo;There is your fish.&rdquo;
In plunged Te Moro, who, swimming rapidly, overtook
his prey and grabbed him just as he reached
the bank. In vain the prophet tried to save himself
by his incantations: &ldquo;Hau Hau, Pai Marire.
Hau&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He gasped the remainder of his discourse,
being interrupted by a smashing cut from the mere,
and Te Moro swam back, towing the dead body,
which he threw down at Haimona&rsquo;s feet.</p>

<p>The fight being over, it was now necessary to count<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
the cost. Out of the 130 Hau Haus who had landed
70 lay dead, 20 badly wounded and 20 were
prisoners, all the balance, with the exception
of one who was known to have made his escape,
being probably more or less disabled, were drowned.
The loss of the Lower River natives was 16 killed
and 50 badly wounded; so that it may be called
a very good fight indeed, second only to that remarkable
combat between the two Kilkenny tom cats&mdash;but
then they were Irish, you know.</p>

<p>The result of this family fall-out effectually saved
the white settlers, as, in the first place, it put
a limit to the spread of the Pai Marire religion
on the Wanganui River and prevented the Lower
River natives from casting in their lot with the Hau
Haus, which, probably, they would have done had
Matene approached them in a conciliatory manner
instead of rubbing them up the wrong way, by
threatening to force the right-of-way on the river.
The township was saved, as were also the outlying
farms and much stock, and the settlers showed
their appreciation of the Lower River natives&rsquo;
gallant conduct by attending <i>en masse</i> the obsequies
of the chiefs and warriors killed in
the fight. This side show, as one may call it, to
the general war that was then raging all over the
country was kept up in a desultory sort of way and
ended in so quaint a manner that I think I may
be pardoned for relating the facts.</p>

<p>After the gentle passage-at-arms on Moutoa, the
discomfited, but still bigoted, Upper River natives
retired to their own country, halting when they
reached Ohotahi, a pah situated higher up the
river but close to Hiruharama. Here they fortified<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
themselves, being allowed ample time to do so by
their chivalrous opponents, as it would have been
bad form and quite foreign to Maori war etiquette
for one enemy to attack another until the defenders
had made everything ready for their assailants&rsquo;
reception. It was therefore not until February
1865 that a strong party of the Lower River
Maoris, under the command of Honi Hipango,
advanced up the river and commenced the siege.
At the first Honi gained some advantages, and
a few men were killed on either side, though much
time was lost in ceremonious sparring; but at last
they really got to work, and Honi was preparing
to rush the place when he was mortally wounded.
His death enraged his men, and the final charge
was moving forward when a woman came out
of the gate, waving a white flag; she was quickly
recognised as being the wife of Pehi Turoa, who
in reality was the great ancestral chief of both
sections of the Wanganui tribe. The appearance
of this aristocratic old dame at once caused an
immediate cessation of hostilities, the firing ceased,
and both sides, quitting their shelter trenches,
met together, squatted down and commenced an
elaborate tangi (ceremonious weeping), in which
they mutually bewailed the killed on both sides;
for the reader must remember that both factions
were closely connected by blood.</p>

<p>The Lower River natives were now on the horns
of a dilemma; eighty Hau Haus were at their
mercy, among them being Pehi Turoa himself, and
these unfortunates should, by all the rules of the
game, be at once immolated as utu for the death of
Honi Hipango, Esq. But it was impossible for them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
to slaughter, in cold blood, their own relations;
neither could they make their own kinsmen
prisoners, especially old Pehi, for that would
smother themselves with dishonour, as it would degrade
their own great hereditary chief and a number
of their own blood relations to the status of slavery,
which would entail shameful ignominy on the whole
of the Wanganui tribe. What then should be done
with Pehi and his party? It was a very hard nut
to crack, and all hands went into committee to solve
the problem, which was at last done in this way,
Pehi himself being the fount of wisdom from which
the adopted suggestion emanated:</p>

<p>The old chief propounded that whereas, for reasons
stated above, it was inexpedient that himself and party
should be knocked on the head, or degraded to slaves,
the only other course open was to let them go; and
that, as it was unseemly for warriors to promenade
around the country unarmed, it would be necessary
for them to take their weapons with them. And to
this suggestion both parties gave a cordial assent.</p>

<p>A treaty was therefore made in which both factions
resolved that they would allow no religious rancour
to disunite again the Wanganui tribe, and that
although each party retained the right to fight
on the side of either white man or Hau Hau, yet
that said fighting must be enjoyed outside their
own country: and this compact was honourably kept
to the end of the war. Up till 1869 the Upper
River natives as a whole sat tight, then joined us so
as to exact utu on Te Kooti for the murder of one
of Turoa&rsquo;s relations. The Lower River natives
became our most staunch allies, for being men of
discernment they quickly tumbled to the fact that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
it was far more humorous and better sport to fight
their old-time enemies, the Taranaki Hau Haus, and
draw pay and rations while enjoying their favourite
&ldquo;divarsion,&rdquo; than to stay at home, or, like their
misguided relatives, dance round a pole and howl,
&ldquo;Hau Hau, Pai Marire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I think before I terminate this yarn I may tell
you about a rather quaint incident that happened
during the siege of Ohotaki, and as it portrays an
idiosyncrasy or trait in Maori character you will
pardon my doing so.</p>

<p>Well, one night a party of Lower River natives
attempted to surprise an outlying detached post
they knew to be weakly held. They crawled up
to the place, and were about to rush it when a
woman&rsquo;s voice called out: &ldquo;Take care what you
do; Te Miere and Te Mokena are here&rdquo;&mdash;these
being the names of two aged men at that time quite
past fighting, but who, in their prime, had been
mighty warriors of great and bloody renown. At
once the storming party retired, for to have
captured a place the garrison of which contained
two such notable veterans would have injured the
prestige of both parties in the eyes of the fighting
population throughout New Zealand.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<small>HOW A SCOUT WON THE NEW ZEALAND CROSS</small></h2>


<p>Up to the year 1879 the Victoria Cross was not to be
won by any officer or man of H.M. Colonial Forces,
although one civilian (Cavanagh) had received it
during the Indian Mutiny, yet in New Zealand
the greatest honour to be won by a Britisher was
denied to all but those actually serving in H.M.
regular army or navy. This being so, the New
Zealand Government obtained royal sanction to
issue a similar cross, only manufactured out of gold
and silver instead of bronze, to be won by the
Colonial troops, and this decoration is designated
the New Zealand Cross.</p>

<p>The yarn I am now going to spin you is how
Trooper George Hill won his while employed as a
scout on the east coast.</p>

<p>In March 1869 the great hardships, the bitter
weather, the large number of wounded and, above
all, the cowardice of our allies, the Arawa tribe, by
far the most pampered by Government, and the only
New Zealand tribe that can be called cowards,
necessitated the Colonial Field Force falling back
from the high plateau of Taupo to Fort Galatea to
recuperate and refit. This gave Te Kooti leisure
to look around for more devilments, and he determined
to strike another blow at the settlements
on the east coast. Calling a meeting of the Hau
Hau tribes at Ruatahuna, he proposed to attack the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
friendly natives and the white settlers at Mohaka
or Te Wairoa. The former place was chosen and
Te Kooti, with 100 bloodthirsty fiends, started to
carry out the raid. Crossing the Huiarau ranges
they came to the Waikare Moana lake. Here
one of those chance occurrences happened that
enabled the astute Te Kooti to keep his hold over
the superstitious natives. On reaching the lake he
issued orders that no man was to cross over before
he did so himself. This order was disobeyed, for a
canoe full of warriors at once started. The lake,
a very large one and, like all others, surrounded by
high mountains, is subject to being swept by sudden
and heavy squalls. One of these overtook the disobedient
warriors, capsized their canoe and although
all managed to get ashore, yet one died from exhaustion,
the remainder losing all their arms, food, etc.</p>

<p>Te Kooti took advantage of this disaster and
made capital out of it. He informed his men that
the order he had promulgated had been issued
direct from God, and that the disobedient warriors
had been punished for non-compliance with it.
Then, seeing the weather was propitious, he entered
a canoe and crossed in safety, his men following without
further misadventure. Te Kooti by doing so
gained much credit in the prophet line and stricter
obedience from his superstitious followers. The
lake being crossed, they pushed on without delay to
the Upper Mohaka, surprised before daylight the
Arakaihi village, and butchered every soul in it, man,
woman and child, with the tomahawk, so as not to
alarm some settlers on the other side of the river.
When daylight came they crossed the river and
murdered with the greatest brutality two white men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
with their wives and three little children, as also
they did another white settler who was unfortunate
enough to fall into their hands alive.</p>

<p>Not satisfied with his morning&rsquo;s successful battue,
Te Kooti and his gang, now increased to 200 men,
hurried on to the Lower Mohaka, which consisted of
two friendly pahs, with a sprinkling of white settlers,
a public-house, store, etc. They arrived there early
in the day and at once attacked the smallest pah,
known as the Huke Pah. The Mohaka friendlies
had received news of Te Kooti&rsquo;s rapid approach
and had sent messengers to warn the troops
stationed at Te Wairoa, only nineteen miles away,
and the authorities at Napier fifty miles distant (of
this more anon).</p>

<p>Nearly all the Mohaka warriors were absent, and
the garrison of the Huke Pah consisted of six men
and a large number of women and children. One
of the defenders, however, named Heta, was a grand
specimen of a Maori warrior, and under his influence
they kept the Hau Haus at bay all that day and
night, and might have held out, had not Te Kooti
resorted to stratagem and by a foul piece of
treachery succeeded in entering the works early
the following morning, when he caused every living
being, regardless of sex and age, to be massacred in
cold blood.</p>

<p>He then turned his attention to the other pah,
Hiruharama, which was garrisoned by only ten
men, but also contained many women and children.
Here he again tried treachery, but this time failed,
as the defenders had seen what had happened at
Huke and were determined to die fighting. He
therefore had to commence to sap up to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
palisades, which were old and rotten, but the nature
of the ground, very hard limestone, delayed him.</p>

<p>It was now that Trooper George Hill chipped
in and took a hand.</p>

<p>Te Kooti&rsquo;s lightning raid had been well conceived
and brilliantly carried out, but luck was decidedly
in his favour, as unfortunately it so chanced that
the officers in charge of the safety of Hawke&rsquo;s Bay
district were on the whole a very poor lot, as far
as efficiency went. Many of the regular Colonial
officers had been killed or rendered <i>hors de combat</i>
during the previous twelve months, the remainder
were with the Field Forces at the front, so that the
duty of guarding the settlements was left in the
hands of the militia or volunteer officers, and these
were quite unfit to cope with Te Kooti.</p>

<p>They had plenty of good men, both friendly
natives and volunteers, with a sufficiency of Armed
Constabulary (the Colonial Regulars) to give them
backbone, but the officers (unfortunately) considered
discretion to be the better part of valour and mistook
timidity for prudence, so much so that they missed
their chance and covered themselves with something
like disgrace. At Te Wairoa the O.C.
had at his disposal 50 mounted men, 25 of whom
were Armed Constabulary, splendidly trained and
mounted, the other 25 armed settlers, all good men.
He also had 200 friendly natives, and the whole of
these men were simply spoiling for a fight.</p>

<p>With one half of them he could have saved the
Huke Pah, and cut up the Hau Haus, very many
of whom had sacked the public-house and were
lying about dead drunk; but he did nothing, for on
receipt of the news, which was quickly confirmed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
and although he was quite aware of the weakness
of the pah&rsquo;s garrison, he asserted he still had
doubts as to the truth of his information and only
despatched Trooper George Hill, of the Armed
Constabulary, to see if Te Kooti was really playing
high jinks at the Mohaka.</p>

<p>Trooper Hill left Te Wairoa, on horseback, and
rode in the direction of the Mohaka. About half-way
he met two mounted settlers, Lamplough and
Burton, who, having heard of Te Kooti&rsquo;s advent,
were doing a scout on their own; these men at once
offered to accompany him, and did so. On reaching
the vicinity of the Mohaka they dismounted, tied up
their horses and crept up a ridge from which they
could observe the place. From this point of
vantage they could see the Huke Pah, with the flag
still flying, and also the puffs of smoke from the rifle
pits of the enemy, so that they were fairly able to
judge the number of the attackers and locate the
positions they occupied.</p>

<p>As there could now be no longer any doubt that Te
Kooti and his gang were on the warpath, Trooper
Hill, leaving the two settlers, both of them good
men, on the ridge to observe the enemy, mounted
his horse and returned towards the camp as fast as
he could get his horse to go. Unfortunately his horse
knocked up, but just then he met three of his comrades,
who had been sent out to look for him. Despatching
one of them to Te Wairoa with his report,
Hill and the other two men, Tew and Mitchell,
returned to Mohaka. Here they tied up their horses
and joined the settlers on the ridge, so as to keep the
enemy under observation and be able to supply the
O.C. of the relieving force with information.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course the A.C. troopers never doubted that
a relieving force would be sent at once, probably
wondered why there was not one on the job already;
but they were not accustomed to militia officers.
Their own officers had no use for timidity, and
regarded prudence and discretion as very good
horses only to be trotted out at long intervals; anyhow,
not one of the men on the ridge would have
believed an angel, had he informed them that no
relieving party would be sent at all.</p>

<p>The five men remained on the ridge till after
dark, and then descended to the flat where they had
tied up their horses. They had, however, been
guilty of an act of folly, insomuch that they had not
left one of their number in charge of their mounts,
for on reaching the place where they had left them
tied up they found one of them had broken his
tether rope and had levanted. As it was necessary
to find the brute, Hill and Tew started away on
foot to do so, each man taking his own line of
search. The other men, instead of remaining quiet,
waited a few minutes, then mounted their horses
and rode over the flat to assist in the hunt. While
doing so, in the pitch darkness, they stumbled over
Tew and foolishly challenged him in Maori. He
promptly answered with a carbine shot that killed
Lamplough&rsquo;s horse. Burton, fancying Tew to be
a Hau Hau, returned the fire, his horse at once
bucking him off and galloping away. The third
man, Trooper Mitchell, hearing the firing and the
galloping of the horses, thought they were attacked
by the enemy, so, shouting to Hill to run, he rode
as hard as he could in the direction he fancied his
comrade had taken, in order to assist him. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
had not gone far when his horse turned turtle over
a flax bush, fell with him, getting away and galloping
off. All of the five men were now dismounted,
each man thinking he was surrounded by Hau
Haus, so they all bolted for an adjacent flax swamp
and hid in the water all the remainder of the night&mdash;a
just punishment for their carelessness and folly.
Daylight revealed the fiasco, and as they were
dismounted they took cover and waited for the
relief party that did not come.</p>

<p>Towards midday 100 Maoris turned up under
the command of a grand old fighting chief, Ihaka
Whanga, but less than 30 of them were to be
relied on, the rest semi Hau Haus, as much to
be feared as trusted.</p>

<p>At once the ridge was lined and Hill saw that
the Huke Pah had fallen, but that the Hiruharama
Pah still held out though closely invested. The
garrison, seeing friends on the ridge, shouted to
them for assistance, as there were not enough men
to hold the place should it be rushed. Among
Ihaka Whanga&rsquo;s party were twenty-five Mohaka
men, and these were the boys ready and willing
to grasp at any plan, no matter how desperate, to
relieve their relations and save the honour of their
pah. George Hill was the man for the emergency.
He explained the only plan was to cut their way
through the besiegers. He was game to lead,
were the twenty-five game to follow? Of course
they were. So, without any thought of prudence,
discretion, or even modesty, Hill whipped off his
boots, tunic, and riding breeches, so as to be able
to run the better, and the gallant twenty-six, shouting
their war-cry, charged the Hau Hau rifle pits.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 50%;">
<img src="images/i_104.jpg" width="100%" alt="A MAORI GIRL." title="" />
<span class="caption">A MAORI GIRL.</span>
</div>

<p>Yes, they charged and charged home, for they
broke their way, by sheer pluck and hard hitting,
right through the ranks of the enemy (Hill killing
his man <i>en route</i>) and reached the gate of the
pah, which they entered, only two of them being
wounded during the rush.</p>

<p>The men left on the ridge opened fire on the
Hau Hau rifle pits, until Te Kooti sent a party
to take them in the rear, when the untrustworthy
natives all bolted, the four white men retired, and
only old Ihaka with two of his men were left.
These three splendid warriors held the position to
the last gasp, then Ihaka gave the word to scatter
and try to get away. The two men were caught
and killed, but the old veteran managed to elude
his pursuers and reach Te Wairoa in safety, where
he gave the O.C. his opinion of his conduct.</p>

<p>On Hill entering the pah he found it to be manned
by small boys and girls, standing on mounds of
earth and stones to enable them to fire over the
parapet, and that even with his twenty-five men
he had not nearly enough hands to man the works.
He at once went to the point of the greatest
danger, a bastion, and could hear the Hau Haus
sapping through the hard ground. He quickly
noticed that the palisades were rotten, so much
so that if the enemy could sap near enough to
throw a pole, attached to a long rope, over the
fence, a strong pull on the rope would cause such
a breach that a storming party could at once enter,
when numbers must gain the day. Fortunately
there was in the pah a number of oxen chains; the
ends of these he made fast to the big corner posts
of the work, and passed the chains outside the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
weak palisades, so rendering that style of attack
abortive.</p>

<p>In the bastion with him he had only two men,
two small boys and three little girls, supplemented
occasionally by the Maori clergyman, who,
between long prayers for the safety of his flock,
hurled all the vituperations and cuss words to be
found in the sacred writings at the heads of
Te Kooti and his followers.</p>

<p>Hill, when he entered the pah, was famished for
want of food; he naturally asked for some, and was
furnished with a cup of tea, one biscuit and one
apple. Surprised at such meagre fare, tendered by
the most hospitable people on earth, he asked for
more and then ascertained that the food he had just
eaten was the very last particles of provisions the
place contained. But the garrison swore that before
they surrendered they would eat their own children
rather than let them fall into the hands of Te Kooti.</p>

<p>All the remainder of that day and the ensuing night
heavy firing was kept up, the Hau Haus attempting
to tear down the palisades; but they were, thanks
to Hill&rsquo;s dodge with the oxen chains, unable to gain
an entrance, although the defenders had frequently
to rush from side to side of the works to oppose
them. At daylight next morning it was discovered
the enemy had constructed a line of rifle pits, close
to the front face of the pah, on which were hoisted
flags, and at sunrise, with much bugling, volley
after volley was poured into the defenders&rsquo; works.</p>

<p>Hill mustered his scanty and tired garrison to
repel the expected rush, and lay quiet, having
directed his men to reserve their fire till the rush
was made.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>After some considerable time had passed the
flags were suddenly withdrawn, the bugling and
volleys ceased, and a dead silence ensued. The
defenders, on the qui vive for some fresh devilry,
sat tight, until one of them, unable to stand the
suspense any longer, crept out and crawled to
the edge of the cliff to reconnoitre. He reached the
edge, took one glance, and was on his feet in a
second, letting out a wild whoop of triumph. Out
tumbled man, woman and child; they lined the
edge of the cliff, and with one accord broke into
a wild war-dance (the parson leading), for still
close, but in full retreat, they saw Te Kooti and
his baffled gang of murderers. Oh, but it was a
glorious triumph, and must be celebrated with
befitting honours, that the great false prophet with
his much-feared, blood-smeared warriors had to
turn their backs on a nearly defenceless pah, whose
garrison consisted chiefly of women and children.</p>

<p>Trooper George Hill, however, had his duty to
perform; he had no time for feasts nor triumphs,
for although the Maoris begged him to remain,
assuring him the roads would be ambuscaded, he
caught one of Te Kooti&rsquo;s knocked-up horses and
started along the Napier Road, so as to convey the
intelligence that the Hau Haus had retreated.
Twelve miles along the track he met with the
advance guard of the relieving column, who had
taken three days to do a journey that should have
been completed in eight hours. The men, mad
with the procrastination and incompetency of their
officers, were nearly in a state of mutiny, but it was
of no avail; for although Trooper Hill reported
Te Kooti had retreated, and offered to guide the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
mounted men on his track, and at all events regain
the plunder, nothing was done, and the Hau
Haus were allowed to retire in peace.</p>

<p>There is no need for me to say any more about
the officers, plenty was said about them at the time
they were incapable; let them rip.</p>

<p>Trooper Hill, however, did not think he had
yet finished his work, for as soon as he had
snatched a bite of food he volunteered to go out
and scout for some of the unfortunate white women
and children who were known to be fugitives or
hidden in the wild bush and fern ranges. This
he did, and succeeded in finding, relieving and
bringing into safety several of the wretched, starving
creatures, who otherwise must have died from
privations.</p>

<p>Trooper George Hill received the New Zealand
Cross, and I for one say he richly deserved it, not
only for the courage he displayed in action, but
also his gallant conduct saved the honour and
repute of the white man amongst the friendly
Maoris who were disgusted by the unfortunate
behaviour of the officers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>A HAU HAU MARTYR</small></h2>


<p>Let me spin you a yarn of how a Maori was so
imbued with fanaticism that he faced in cold blood
extinction for the same.</p>

<p>Many of the Hau Haus, bloodthirsty, cruel fanatics
as they were, whom the Colonial forces ruthlessly
knocked on the head during the latter half of the
New Zealand wars, are just as much entitled to be
enrolled in the army of martyrs as are the early
Christians or any other poor devils who have
perished by fire or sword for believing and sticking
to their faith.</p>

<p>Again, there are many instances of Hau Haus
who were so strong in their convictions that they
of their own free will deliberately offered themselves
up to undergo the fiery ordeal by leaving their
harbours of safety and, unarmed, trusting alone to
spiritual aid, faced certain death; and I have never
read of any persecuted communities doing the
same.</p>

<p>When in 1865 the Pai Marire religion was promulgated
by a demented Maori named Te Ua,
the two principal promises held out to induce the
Maoris to join the new religion were: first, that
they should be rendered invulnerable in action; and,
secondly, that they should be granted the gift of
tongues. They were also promised the assistance of
legions of angels, and that those white soldiers who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
were not turned into stone should with the rest of
the settlers be driven into the sea, after which the
natives should be given the knowledge of all the
European arts and sciences. Please note he made
no promise about a future state, nor, like Mahomet,
did he invent any gorgeous paradise, thronged with
pretty girls, where free drinks would be served out
<i>ad libitum</i>.</p>

<p>Now these were queer promises to captivate a
Maori warrior, as after the first excitement there
was but little in them to induce him to abandon
Christianity and cling to Hau Hauism. Let us
take them <i>seriatim</i>, remembering at the same time
that the Maori is an astute reasoner. First of all
the promise of invulnerability. Well, that would be
all right so long as they only had to fight against
the white man, but the pakeha was to be driven out,
and what would follow then? War was the Maori&rsquo;s
greatest pleasure, and each tribe hated his neighbour
quite as much as he hated the white man.
Yet his neighbour was to become just as invulnerable
as he was to be himself. Where, therefore,
would be the fun if he could not kill his enemy, eat
him, nor turn his bones into useful and ornamental
articles? Bah! the zest of war would be gone.
Then again the second promise. What on earth
use could the gift of tongues be to a man when
there was not to be a single foreigner left in the
country with whom to collogue? As for the other
promises, they were not worth a row of pins, for if
the warriors became invulnerable they wanted no
further angelic aid; and as far as acquiring the arts
and sciences went, so long as they could learn how
to make rum and grow tobacco, all the rest could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
go swing, they being willing to live as their fathers
had lived before them.</p>

<p>Now I am sure that if the natives had only
reasoned as I have just done they would not have
thrown off their Christianity in such a hurry and
become stark raving Hau Haus; but they seem on
this occasion to have lost their wits altogether, for,
carried away by the crazy incantations of Te Ua&rsquo;s
apostles, they not only embraced the new faith, but
believed in the truth of it, so much so that there are
plenty of instances of their laying down their lives
for it&mdash;and no man can do more.</p>

<p>Another wonderful thing is that even after four
years&rsquo; continuous fighting, during which period the
angel had not only failed to bear a hand, but had
not even rendered one man invulnerable, as apostle,
priest and warrior had been put out of mess by the
white man&rsquo;s bullet, still they were strong in their
faith, and there are plenty of instances of Hau
Haus, believing in the promise of the angel, offering
their bodies as a target so as to prove the truth of
their religion. And now for the yarn.</p>

<p>The scene is a Maori kainga on the east coast of
New Zealand, date 1869, time of day about 9 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>
The village, composed of some twenty huts, stands
in a clearing surrounded by dense bush, and in the
foreground stands the Niu, the sacred pole round
which the fanatics perform their mad dances and
mystic incantations. I said it was a Maori kainga;
so it had been, though the only Maoris at present
inside it are perhaps a score, and these lie about
very dead indeed. The remainder of its whilom
inhabitants have fled away into the depths of the
bush and are safe from the pursuit of the strong<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
party of Colonial Irregulars, who, having, after a
long, wearying night&rsquo;s march, surprised and rushed
the place at daybreak, are now in occupation of it.
These men, having eaten their frugal meal, and
worn out by their overnight&rsquo;s march, with the
exception of the guard lie around booted and
belted and with their carbines by their sides, trying
to get what sleep they can, as at any moment they
may again be called upon for active service. On
the low fence surrounding the Niu ring, which is
about thirty feet in diameter, the ground within the
magic circle being trampled as hard and smooth as
stone pavement by the feet of its former worshippers,
lounge some half-dozen officers smoking and
dozing. The day is a fine one, the sun shines hot,
the white men rest, the Hau Haus, far away in the
recesses of the bush, bind up their wounds and talk
of utu (revenge). No, not all of them, for the
undergrowth parts and out into the clearing strides
a big, stark-naked Maori, who, without paying the
slightest attention to any of the astonished and
by now wideawake men, passes through them and,
without apparently seeing the group of officers,
enters the Niu ring, where, after saluting the pole,
he prances slowly round it, chanting in a minor key
the words: &ldquo;Hau Hau, Pai Marire&rdquo; (Wind, wind,
good, peaceful), over and over again. Gradually he
gets up steam and, paying no attention to the
throng of armed enemies who now surround the
mystic circle, he cavorts higher and faster, while
his monotonous chant is raised to the full gamut
of his deep, bass voice. Presently he foams at the
mouth, his features become distorted, sweat pours
through his skin like water, on his hands held rigid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
his fingers quiver, while with leaps and bounds his
stamping feet beat time to the chant of &ldquo;Hau Hau,
Pai Marire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How long this exhibition would have continued
the Lord only knows, for it was brought to a
sudden termination by a big Scotch Presbyterian
sergeant, who, being as bigoted as they make them,
could not tolerate the ritual of a foreign denomination,
so he stepped out of the crowd of men and, as
the fanatic devotee pranced past him, he with a leg
as brawny as that of a Highland stot let fly a kick, at
the same time exclaiming: &ldquo;Hae done, ye pagan,
wi yer satanic cantrips.&rdquo; Out flew the No. 12 boot,
which, catching the unfortunate bounder fair and
square on the crupper bone, launched him through
space till, the momentum being expended, he landed
on his nose at the Colonel&rsquo;s feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get up,&rdquo; quoth the O.C. in Maori, at the same
time giving the officious non-com. a look that made
the ower-guid mon wilt. &ldquo;Now, what made you
come here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Colonel spoke the language like a native,
and what he did not know about Hau Haus was
not worth learning, so he was not in the least bit
surprised when the somewhat blown native staggered
to his feet and answered him in perfect
English: &ldquo;I came here among you to turn you all
into stone, and should have done so had not that
man, whose head is fit to be boiled, interrupted me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; replied the O.C., &ldquo;I know you; you
assisted Nama to torture women and children at
Poverty Bay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; triumphantly exclaimed the fanatic.
&ldquo;Sweet is the blood of women and children.&rdquo; (Note<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
this fellow had been mission bred and educated, in
fact had acted as a lay Bible reader.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, is it,&rdquo; growled the Colonel. &ldquo;Sergeant
O&rsquo;Halloran, detail four men, take this fellow to that
tree and do your duty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Sergeant saluted smartly, quickly told off
four men, advanced to his prisoner, whose arm he
grasped with a shoulder-of-mutton fist, at the same
time exclaiming: &ldquo;Come along wid me, ye bloody-minded
Fanian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few steps took them to the huge tortara-tree
that had been pointed out, against the trunk of
which the Sergeant, drawing his revolver, placed
the Hau Hau. &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;a Christian
ye were wance, and a bloody pagan ye are now,
bad luck to the likes of ye, but ave ye wist to
recant and make yer sowl, sure it&rsquo;s foive minutes
I&rsquo;ll give ye to make it.&mdash;Fall in, boys, tin yards
forninst us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now no good soldier man, be he regular or
irregular, likes to make one of a firing party,
told off to shoot a man in cold blood, law or no
law, and it is usual in such cases to detail the
worst characters in a regiment to perform that
obnoxious duty; but when it comes to letting daylight
into a fiend who brags of having tortured
helpless women and children, then no frontiersman
jibs at making one of a party to do so. Therefore,
no matter how distasteful the job might be to any
of the four men told off on this special occasion, they
fell in with great alacrity and brought their carbines
to the shoulder like one man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurry up, ye spalpeen, and make yer sowl,&rdquo;
quoth the Sergeant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t shoot me,&rdquo; replied the fanatic, &ldquo;the
great Gabriel and all his angels protect me; you
can&rsquo;t kill me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nabocklish&rdquo; (maybe not), answered the imperturbable
non-com., &ldquo;but by the holy poker we&rsquo;ll
have a darned good try. Will yez call on the
blessed saints or not, ye contumacious blaggard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hau Hau, Pai Marire,&rdquo; shouted the fanatic, raising
his arms, stretching them to the full extent and
turning the hands, palms outwards, towards the
firing party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, thin ye won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; growled the now somewhat
enraged non-com., &ldquo;thin go to hell yer own way.
Ready!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hau Hau, Pai Marire,&rdquo; yelled the fanatic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Present!&rdquo; ordered the Sergeant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hau Hau, Pai Marire,&rdquo; triumphantly shrieked
the Maori.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fire!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hau Hau&rdquo; bang came all together, and the
misguided fanatic, smote full in the chest by four
sneider bullets, collapsed and fell on his face as
dead as Julius C&aelig;sar.</p>

<p>Now was that Hau Hau, blood-stained brute as
he undoubtedly was, a martyr or only a bally fool?
Remember, he had only a few hours previously
escaped from out of a sharp fight in which many of
his co-religionists had been killed, and after winning
through to safety himself he is so strong in his
faith that he voluntarily returns alone and unarmed
to justify the truth of his conviction, although he
well knows he is facing certain death providing he
be wrong in his belief.</p>

<p>You may call him which or what you please, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
I maintain that he is just as much to be enrolled in
the army of martyrs as any of the poor devils who
were stretched on red-hot gridirons, or were put to
death in other unpleasant ways, for testifying to what
they believed to be the truth.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<small>A BRUSH WITH BUSHRANGERS</small></h2>

<p>(<i>Told by the Old Identity</i>)</p>


<p>In Australia, during the early seventies, bushrangers
were still to the fore, who with cattle-thieves
and hostile blacks made the squatters on
the back blocks keep their eyes skinned, and the
banker in the bush townships cash a cheque with
one hand, while he kept the other on his revolver.</p>

<p>True the mounted police were very good, none
better, but, like the British army, there were not
enough of them, and the amount of work in covering,
protecting and patrolling such enormous areas
of country was far beyond what their limited
number could properly do. Indeed, there are
plenty of well-known cases where the bushrangers
have overcome the police, handcuffed them in their
own station, then stuck up the bank and, after
raiding the town, started off on the best horses
in the place and disappeared into the bush, not to
be heard of again until they bailed up a coach, or
stuck up some station, perhaps 150 miles away.
Well, to get on with my yarn.</p>

<p>Some six and thirty years ago I was on leave
in Australia, and was putting in some of it as a
guest on a large cattle run and sheep station
owned by two old friends of mine who had already
become wealthy men, and who owned an enormous
number of cattle and sheep.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>The house, like most of its sort at that time in
Australia, was built of split slabs of wood, with a
shingle roof. It contained four good-sized rooms
and a very wide hall running right through it,
which was used as a dining-room and lounge.</p>

<p>The kitchen and offices were close to, in rear of
the house, and the men&rsquo;s quarters, stables, store
and outhouses were near by. The whole block of
buildings stood in the open, and was surrounded
by wire-fenced paddocks, so that no one could
approach within a long distance of the house on
any side without being seen. My friends&rsquo; home
staff at that time consisted of six white men, all
good and to be relied upon, also two China boy-cooks,
and a few aborigines (black fellows) who
were used as trackers and stock-riders. All of these
men were well armed, so that with our three selves
we made a garrison quite able to beat off any
attack of bushrangers or blacks.</p>

<p>I had come up from Brisbane with one of the
partners to join in mustering semi-wild cattle,
cutting them off from the bush by moonlight and
driving them into a mob of tame cattle driven
along for the purpose, and then forcing them into
a run that led to the stockyards, where they would
be drafted and disposed of. There is no more
exciting work in the world for a good horseman
who is well mounted, can use a stock whip, and
who puts no excessive value on his neck or bones.</p>

<p>The cutting-out was to begin next week, and
some of the best of my friends&rsquo; numerous and
splendid stud of horses had been brought in from
the paddocks and fed up on hard food, so as to
get them into good fettle and wind for the work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>At Brisbane and all the way up by Cob &amp;
Co.&rsquo;s coach we had heard plenty of shaves about
bushrangers, especially of one gang led by a
scoundrel called Ginger, who, having been hunted
over the border from New South Wales, was
making things lively in Queensland; as if that
colony had not sufficient blackguards of her own
growth to look after. These shaves were confirmed
at the small bush township, where we left the
coach, by the solitary trooper in charge there, who
informed my companion that the sergeant and other
troopers were away on patrol after this bounder.</p>

<p>There was no telegraphic communication in
those days, and all the information we could
get was that Ginger&rsquo;s gang consisted of four,
or it might be eight, men. So our traps having
been placed in a light cart that had been sent for
them, we mounted two slashing horses and rode
the forty miles to the station, my friend hearing the
news from his head stock-rider, named Blake, who
had brought over the horses. This man, a splendid
stamp of a Sidney-side Colonial, was convinced we
should hear more of Mr Ginger, but feared we
should be disappointed in our muster, as our neighbours,
having to look after their own homes, would
not come in for it.</p>

<p>Well, we reached the station, and I put in
two days very contentedly indeed, picking and
trying my horses, selecting a stock-whip and
kit, and amusing myself generally, so much so
that on the evening of the second day, after a
good dinner, when we were sitting smoking under
the verandah, I bothered my head not at all about
Ginger. Presently one of my friends looked up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
and said: &ldquo;Hallo, here&rsquo;s someone coming, and
in no end of a hurry too.&rdquo; We looked and saw
the township trooper riding as fast as he could get
his horse to travel towards us. He reached us and
dismounted, giving his pumped-out horse to one of
the blacks who had come for it, and took and drank
thankfully the proffered drink, then said: &ldquo;Mr&mdash;Ginger
is in the district, and I have been riding
since yesterday morning giving the squatters
notice to be on the qui vive. I left your station
to the last, as the inspector knows you are well
armed and your men are to be relied on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come and have something to eat first and tell
your yarn afterwards,&rdquo; quoth my host, and we adjourned
to the hall, where, after the trooper had
eaten with the appetite of a half-starved dingo, he
informed us that Ginger had reached the district,
sticking up stations on his way, and that the
inspector with fifteen men were on his track. He
had evidently intended to stick up the township,
but the arrival of the police had prevented this,
so he disappeared, and the inspector thought he
would make the attempt to break south again. He
therefore requested my friend for the loan of as
many men and horses as he could spare, so as to
accompany the trooper and stop a gap called the
divide, through which the scoundrels might try to
break, and where he promised to meet them,
during the next twenty-four hours, but at the same
time warned them not to leave their station short-handed,
as it was quite possible Ginger, close
pressed, might try to stick them up so as to steal
fresh horses and food.</p>

<p>Blake was sent for, a short council of war was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
held and his proposal that himself, two of the white
men and two black trackers should accompany the
trooper was decided on. &ldquo;And perhaps,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;the Captain here would like to come with us;
fighting is in his line, and, my word! if we corner
Ginger we shall have some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Ginger was no business of mine, unless he
attacked me; but, being an Irishman, I could not
let the chance of a fight pass, and although my
friends tried to dissuade me, I determined to go.</p>

<p>We were to start at midnight, so we who were to
go lay down to get what rest we could, leaving the
others to get the horses ready for us. At midnight
we were roused up, and after swallowing a mug of
tea and some food, a hurried glance over my horse
and kit, to see that my water-bag was well filled and
properly slung to the D&rsquo;s of my saddle, we started.</p>

<p>We were all superbly mounted and well armed,
each man carrying two revolvers; I would sooner
have carried a carbine, but I was dissuaded, and we
had cause to regret it. The fight might have finished
much sooner had I done as I judged best; but I was
in what was to me a foreign country and, having no
official status, gave in to the others. So we started,
the blacks leading; and they did lead us. No sooner
were we clear of the paddock fences than we broke
into a canter, and made for a dense line of bushes
about five miles off, and just as we reached it the
moon went down. I expected to see the blacks
pull up and walk their horses, but not a bit of it.
On they went at the same pace. The bush was
some miles through, but no crow could have crossed
it in a straighter line than they did. On reaching
the open ground on the other side we halted and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
dismounted, for a short time, so as to give our steeds
a blow. It was now pitch dark, with not even the
glimmer of a star, yet no sooner had we mounted
than we broke into a canter again, and rode through
open park-like country and bush till the east began
to lighten, when we pulled up at a small water-hole.</p>

<p>This was the spot our guides had aimed for, and
it was at least twenty miles from our starting-point,
so it will give you some idea of the marvellous
abilities of these creatures. To be able to ride
twenty miles at a sharp pace, through trackless
country, on a dark night, and exactly strike the
spot they aimed for, was to me wonderful. It may
not strike you so, but try it.</p>

<p>We off-saddled, rubbed down, watered and fed
our horses out of their nose-bags, then ate some
cold mutton and damper, and dozed for a couple of
hours, leaving the blacks to keep watch over us and
our horses. Saddling up again we rode through
clumps of bush and up gently rising ground towards
a range of heavily bushed mountains, some ten
miles off, through which ran the divide, or pass, we
were to guard. We halted when we reached the
foot of the range, and took cover in a small clump
of bush, off-saddled and sent one black on foot to
scout the pass and find by the spoor if anyone had
crossed it during the last twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Of course, being an utter stranger in the land, I
knew nothing of the lay of the country, nor even
where the pass was; but a rather acrid discussion
took place between the stockriders, who declared
we were badly posted, and the trooper, who asserted
we were not. Unable to give an opinion either
way, I was lying down with my head on my saddle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
when we were roused by some shots. I jumped to
my feet just in time to see our scout burst out of
a clump of bush and run like a hare towards us,
closely followed by four mounted men firing at him.</p>

<p>They were about 500 yards off, and had I
had my carbine I could easily have covered the
black, and perhaps have ended the job there and
then; but my carbine was like the Dutchman&rsquo;s
anchor, left at home, so there was nothing to do
but throw our saddles on and try to save him.
Quick and smart as we were, we were too late to
save poor Tarpot, who was ridden down and
riddled. As each of us got into his saddle he
charged, and the bushrangers, seeing us coming,
turned and galloped back to the bush from which
they had issued. I was the fourth to mount, and as
I galloped out of the bush I saw the three men in
front of me riding in file as hard as they could
gallop, with as much as from twenty to thirty yards
between them. This was rot; as, if the bushrangers
made a stand on reaching their bush, as they were
certain to do, they would simply shoot us down
from behind cover, one after the other. I therefore
shouted to the leading men to rein in and let
us get into line; but their blood was up, and on
they went. I pulled out to their left, and Blake
and the remaining black pulled out to my left.
We were therefore in extended line, some fifty
yards to the left rear of the last man of the leading
three who were in file. The distance was short,
and as we were all riding like fiends we soon crossed
the open ground between the two clumps of bush.</p>

<p>The trooper, who was the leading man, was
within thirty yards of entering it when I saw him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
throw up his hands and fall headlong from his
horse. In a second No. 2 had done the same,
and a moment later No. 3 went down, horse and
man. Myself and the other two, riding wide of
the line of fire, escaped and, although several shots
were fired at us, gained the bush unhurt. Then,
being on equal terms with the bushrangers, we
wheeled our horses to the right and rode at them.</p>

<p>Just at this moment I heard shouts and shots
going on close to, at the other side of the bush, but
had no time to inquire if it were friends or foes. I
spotted a horse&rsquo;s head coming round a tree-trunk,
and was ready for the rider. He appeared, and
saw me; but I had him already covered, and had
the pleasure of seeing him lurch out of his saddle
and come a heavy crumpler. My mates were
alongside of me, and we were just going after
another bounder, whose horse&rsquo;s hindquarters were
disappearing, when an officer and three troopers
broke out on us, and called on us to bail up. In
less than a minute we explained who we were, and
I was just starting off after the fugitives when the
officer called on me to halt, and in a rather haughty
manner informed me that he was in command of
the party, and that he intended to halt until he had
collected his scattered men, some of whom were
wounded. As he only stated the truth, I was not
such a fool as to feel offended with him, so I went
with Blake to see if anything could be done for
our fallen mates.</p>

<p>The trooper and the first stockman were both
dead, the third man was unwounded, but his horse
had been killed, and he had been knocked stiff and
silly by the heavy fall. However, after some water<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
and a stiff nip he was soon all right, and swearing
he would make the blank-blank-blankety-blank
bounders who had killed his pet stock horse and
his mate sit up.</p>

<p>We quickly caught the loose horses and were
soon joined by the officer and his troopers, who
were a very fine, smart-looking crowd, but, to my
mind, far too big and too heavy for this sort of
game. They had two of their number badly
wounded, but had wounded and captured three
bushrangers, so that, with the one I had put out
of mess, Ginger could now have only three men
with him. The officer, therefore, determined to
follow their spoor with our party and four of his
own men. Messengers were despatched to other
patrols and to the nearest station to obtain a
conveyance for the wounded men, and we started
under the guidance of Jampot, our remaining black.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think he will be able to track them?&rdquo;
I asked Blake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My word,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;Jampot has now a
blood feud against Ginger, and will follow him
to the death. Ginger may turn and twist how
he likes, but unless he can grow wings, or kill
Jampot, Jampot will kill him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had seen plenty of tracking in my time&mdash;I
even had the cheek to fancy myself a bit at it&mdash;and
had seen good work done both by white men and
Maoris. I had even seen a tame black fellow
after stray cattle; but I was now to see a real warrior
black, with a blood feud, at the game. I expected
a great deal, and I was not disappointed&mdash;in
fact I saw more than I had ever imagined to be
possible. Well, we were ready to start.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>Jampot had made use of the time in transmogrifying
himself into a fiend, and he certainly looked
a hideous nightmare in his war paint. Jumping on
his horse, he rode to the end of the bush, circled
once or twice to take note of the different spoors,
then broke into a canter and rode nearly due south.</p>

<p>Mile after mile he kept on, over all sorts of
ground, through bush and over hard land, never
pausing for an instant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to tell me that that black fellow
can see spoor going at this pace and over such
ground as we are now on?&rdquo; said I to Blake.</p>

<p>He only nodded his head and muttered: &ldquo;My
word!&rdquo; This is a great Australian expression, and
will signify almost anything.</p>

<p>We came to a creek, and Jampot was off his
horse in a second and was examining the rocks
round the water-holes. All at once he held up
his hand; Blake and myself went carefully to him.</p>

<p>Blake and he talked gibberish for a minute, then,
turning to me, the former said: &ldquo;Jampot tells me
one of them is badly hit and can&rsquo;t go far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How on earth does he know that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has seen blood on the trail and can tell
by the tracks on these rocks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tracks?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He spoke to Jampot, who immediately put his
finger on several places on the rocks.</p>

<p>I examined the spots closely, but could see
nothing, not even when I used a prospecting-glass
I had in my pocket. Yet this marvellous savage
could distinguish spoor with his naked eye, and
had spotted blood-marks on the trail while going
at a smart canter in blazing sunshine, where I could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
only now and then just barely see hoof-marks.
Jampot was now very keen to go on, so after we
had given our horses a blow and a few go-downs
of water it was a case of mount and canter.</p>

<p>Away we went, Jampot leading; but now he
went slower, and occasionally swerved from his
line, bending down and regarding the ground
intently. We had only gone a couple of miles
or so when he turned in his saddle and, with a grin
on his face a fiend would have envied, pointed
at a small clump of bushes to his right front, and
made directly for them.</p>

<p>Drawing our revolvers, we followed, to find him
dismounted, bending over the body of a dead man.</p>

<p>He was a fine-looking, clean-built young fellow,
and seemed far too good for the game he had been
playing. But there was no time for moralising; so,
preventing Jampot from mutilating the remains, we
again mounted, broke into a canter, and went on.</p>

<p>The weight they carried had now begun to tell
on the troopers&rsquo; horses, and they showed signs of
having had enough of it: and presently we came
to a dead horse. He had been wantonly shot, and
it made my blood boil to see the poor brute lie
there.</p>

<p>We were now approaching a long bare line of
hills, and suddenly Jampot let a yell out of him and
pointed at them. I unslung my field-glasses, and
could see three men, dismounted, leading their
horses, nearly at the top of the range, and about
three miles in front of us.</p>

<p>We at once gave our horses the spur and went
for them.</p>

<p>They reached the summit, paused for a minute<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
or two to give their horses a blow, mounted and
disappeared over the sky-line. We reached the
hill, jumped off, and hurried up it, leading our
horses; but the gallop had finished the troopers&rsquo;
nags, and when we got to the top the officer
found, with the exception of my party, he was alone.
His horse was done, and even the hard-fed,
splendid mounts of myself and mates had begun
to show symptoms of distress. Quickly unscrewing
the top of my flask, I emptied the spirits into my
water-bag, and forced my horse to drink the
contents. My comrades immediately followed my
example and the noble beasts soon bucked up.</p>

<p>In the meantime the sergeant had reached the
top, and with the officer and Blake held a consultation
as to where we were, Jampot being called on
to assist.</p>

<p>He spoke to Blake, who turned round and
ejaculated: &ldquo;My word, those hounds are making
for Edwards&rsquo; Station. It&rsquo;s only six miles off.
The men are away; there are women and children
there, and fresh horses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The officer at once said to me: &ldquo;You and your
party are the best mounted and the lightest weights.
Jampot may be able to take you a short cut. Ride
like fury. You may be just in time, and if it comes
to fighting you know all about that; but on no
account leave there till I come.&rdquo; He said something
more about not letting the bushrangers get
fresh horses; but his words of wisdom were left
behind us, for we were off, and I had the wildest
ride I ever had in my life. The slope of the hill
was steep and rough, but we tore down it at full
pace.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>Our horses, maddened with the spur, almost
seemed to fly, clearing rocks and fallen timber
as if they were simply straws, while we, rendered
desperate by the thought of the danger of the
women and children, urged them on with voice and
spur, though we wisely gave them their heads and
let their mouths alone.</p>

<p>They were all bush-bred horses, knew their
work and did it without a fault or fall, which would
have been certain death to both man and beast.</p>

<p>Well, we came to the foot of the hill and each
man, taking his own line, although Jampot still led,
galloped through the bush, every man riding all
he knew.</p>

<p>Soon we came to the open and saw the house;
yes, and we saw something else, for in front of it
stood three knocked-up horses with hanging heads.
A paddock with a heavy post-and-rail fence lay
between us, so, catching hold of our horses&rsquo; heads,
we sent them at it. Over we went, in line, and
charged for the house, a woman&rsquo;s scream causing
us, if possible, to put on pace. Just then we saw a
man coming from the stable leading three horses,
and he saw us at the same time. Our appearance,
from an unexpected direction, must have rattled
him a bit. The horses he led, excited by the sound
of our galloping hoofs, became restive and started
plunging, so he let them go as Blake rode for him.
I heard the pistol shots, but could pay no attention,
as out from the French windows rushed two men.
They made for the horses, then, seeing they had no
chance, turned and opened fire on us.</p>

<p>The man nearest me had a big red beard, and I
knew he must be Ginger, so I rode at him. Jampot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
rode at him too, firing as fast as he could; and this
most likely upset Ginger&rsquo;s aim as, although I heard
bullets whistle past me as I lay on my horse&rsquo;s neck,
I was unwounded. When I was within twenty
yards of him I fired twice and circled left, so as not
to crash into the house. Both shots took effect.
He fell, and was still trying to cover me when
Jampot, jumping off his horse, rushed up to him and
shot him through the head. Blake now joined us,
slightly wounded, having accounted for his man,
and we found our other mate on the ground badly
hurt; he had succeeded in also dropping his man,
who, preferring to be hung instead of shot, surrendered.</p>

<p>I entered the house and found the ladies unhurt
but badly frightened. They, however, with the
self-control and handiness of colonial women, at
once set to work to tend the wounded.</p>

<p>Jampot was still amusing himself with the
remains of Ginger, but, as it is against my principles
to allow heathen ceremonies to be performed on a
white man, no matter how big a blackguard he has
been, I made him desist and help me to look after
the horses, the real heroes of the play.</p>

<p>The China boy-cook came out of his hiding-place
and started to cook huge supplies of food for
ourselves and the troopers, who turned up soon
afterwards.</p>

<p>A swim in a water-hole, a good dinner, a long
sleep, and on the following morning myself, Blake
and Jampot returned home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>THE SCOUT THAT FAILED</small></h2>

<p>(<i>Told by the Kia Tangata</i>)</p>


<p>Scouting, like every other sort of business, has
its ups and downs, and a scout may often fail to
obtain the information he has gone out to gain,
through no fault of his own. He may even lose
the number of his mess, be captured, or have to
ride or run for his life, notwithstanding the fact
that he has played the right game from the start,
until something happens, and he fails, frequently
through bad luck, or because the vigilance of the
enemy renders it impossible to achieve success. It
has been my lot, as it has been the lot of many a
better man, to fail frequently while scouting, and on
more than one occasion I have been spotted by the
enemy and have had to ride or run hard to save
my bacon, without completing the duty on which I
had been despatched. A yarn about one of these
occasions may amuse you, although there is but
little information as regards scouting in it.</p>

<p>It was in the year 1869 that we were after Te
Kooti and the rebel Hau Haus in the Taupo
district, and were building a chain of forts from
Napier to Lake Taupo, so as to cut off the Uriwera
and east-coast Hau Haus from the King Country
and Taupo rebels.</p>

<p>Lake Taupo is a huge expanse of water on the
high plateau in the centre of the North Island of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
New Zealand, and is fed by many rivers, creeks and
boiling springs; but there is only one outlet to drain
off its superfluous water, and this is called the River
Waikato, which debouches out of the north-east
corner of the lake in a deep and very rapid stream,
running east, then bends north and north-west,
forming a big bow; then turning to the north it
eventually makes a sharp turn to the west, and
flows into the Pacific Ocean south of Manakau
Harbour.</p>

<p>This river, fed as it is from the big lake and also
by innumerable tributaries, is, although not very
broad, a most dangerous one to cross, especially
while it is descending from the high plateau, as it
either rushes through high banks or tumbles in
foaming cataracts among large rocks until at last,
as if tired with its exertions, it becomes a well-behaved,
navigable river, and forms what was in
early times one of the only roads into the interior
of New Zealand; but during its whole course from
the lake to the ocean it is a dangerous one to play
with.</p>

<p>On the precipitous south bank of this river, some
200 yards from the lake, we were, in 1869, building
a redoubt called Tapuaeharuru (the Place of Sounding
Footsteps), and it was from this fort that I
was ordered to ride to Te-Niho-te-Kiori (the Rat&rsquo;s
Tooth), an enormous pinnacle of rock that springs
from the ground just where the river starts on its
long flow to the north. I was therefore, as it were,
to ride along the string of a bent bow and, if
successful in reaching this rock, to try and open
communications with another column supposed to
be in its vicinity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not what some people might call a safe
journey: road there was none, and the route I had
to take was through country that, although it could
not be called mountainous nor thickly bushed, was
covered with manuka scrub and wire grass, with
here and there a clump of heavy timber, while
an occasional column of snowwhite steam, rising
into the air, denoted a boiling spring. These
columns were of different magnitude, and as I knew
which side of the river the principal geysers were
on, and their situation, as seen from the river and
fort, they proved most useful landmarks to me
later on in the day.</p>

<p>At daybreak one lovely morning I plumped
my saddle into a canoe and was ferried across the
stream, my horse swimming astern, and on gaining
the bank, after drying his back, I carefully saddled-up,
lit my pipe and, with a cheery &ldquo;So long&rdquo; to the
men who had paddled me over, mounted and rode
away.</p>

<p>As soon as I was out of rifle-range of the camp
I was in No Man&rsquo;s Land, and every native I met
would be an enemy. I had twenty-five miles to
ride to get to the Rat&rsquo;s Tooth, and had to depend
entirely on my own wit and the good qualities
of my horse to save my hair, in case I fell across
any parties of wandering Hau Haus. My orders
also directed me to look out for any signs of the
enemy, and in case I cut a spoor I was to prospect
it and try to ascertain if it were the track of a
Taua (war party) or not.</p>

<p>The horse I rode was indeed a noble brute.
Standing fifteen hands, he possessed every quality
that a scout&rsquo;s horse should. Not only was he very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
well bred, fast and strong, but he combined the
manners of a lady with the courage of the lion,
could scramble like a cat and swim like a fish; and
all these qualities he was destined to display before
that day was over. As, if possible, I was to return
the same day, I rode light, carrying nothing on
my saddle except half-a-feed for my horse and a
couple of biscuits for myself. I wore neither tunic
nor sword, but carried a carbine, with the usual
revolver and knife, while my dress consisted only
of a smasher hat, shirt, breeches and boots, with
very short-necked spurs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is nothing half so sweet in life as love&rsquo;s
young dream,&rdquo; sings the poet, but I&rsquo;ll gamble that a
smart canter on a high-bred, free-going horse beats
dreaming all to fits, and is much better for you.
Anyhow I thoroughly enjoyed the first part of
that ride through the sharp, clear air, notwithstanding
that I had to keep every sense on deck,
and my thoughts, concentrated by looking out for
an enemy or for hostile spoor, were occupied with
far sterner matters than love or dalliance. For the
first six miles or so I made good progress, the
ground being fairly open and the obstacles quite
insignificant; but then I reached a part where a
chain of heavily bushed hills ran on my left hand
for some miles, the river being six miles to my right.
The pumice-stone flat over which I was riding
was here much cut up by gullies running from the
hills to the river; some of them containing creeks,
the remainder being dry, but all of them with
nearly perpendicular sides, which, except in places,
were not to be negotiated by horse or man. As
the depth of them varied so did the direction, some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
of them running into one another, while the others
ran direct to the river. These I had to cross, and
it was very nasty, dangerous work, in more ways
than one.</p>

<p>First of all I had to look for a place where my
horse could descend into the bed of the gully, at
the same time looking out for a place on the other
side up which we could scramble. This took time,
as occasionally I had to ride a considerable distance
up or down the edge before I could find a place
suitable either to descend or to get out again;
and it would have been an act of madness for me
to have gone down into one of these ravines without
having spotted a way of getting out again.
Yet, at the same time, cross them I must. Again
I had to make mental notes of every crossing, and
take bearings, so that I should remember each
gully and how to get back. I never forgot for a
moment I was in an enemy&rsquo;s country and that
perhaps my return journey might be expedited
by a taua; besides, I had to keep my eyes open
for an ambush, as it was quite possible I had
already been spotted from the hills, among which
many Hau Haus might be lurking, as the Maoris
always make their plantations in the bush.</p>

<p>I had crossed some ten of these gullies when I
came to a very big one, about forty feet deep and
perhaps fifty yards broad. With trouble I could
get down into this, but could not see, although I
rode a considerable distance along its edge, any
way of getting out on the other side. There was,
however, another gully running into it that apparently
took a northerly direction&mdash;the way I wanted
to go&mdash;and if I entered this one and followed it I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
might be able to regain the level of the plain
farther on.</p>

<p>It was a very grave risk to run, but it was a
case of Hobson&rsquo;s choice, that or none; so, after a
long look at the hills, to see if I could spot any
signs of danger from them, I hardened my heart,
descended with a nasty scramble and made for the
entrance of the gully I had seen from the plain.
I had no sooner reached the mouth of it than I
reined up sharply, for there, clearly defined, and
not twenty-four hours old, were the tracks of at
least twenty, perhaps thirty, horses that, coming
from the north, had turned to the right on reaching
the big gully and proceeded towards the hills. As
there was no spoor returning, it was evident that
a number of the enemy must be located in their
bushed recesses, and, in case they should have
spotted me, they would most certainly do their
best to cut me off. Yet, as their horses had used
the gully, there must be a way out of it, and if I
made a push for it I could take advantage of it
to regain the level of the plain; anyhow it was no
use staying where I was. I must go back, or go on.</p>

<p>Naturally, I was keen to complete my duty; so
as soon as I had taken a good look at my carbine
and revolver I entered the gully and rode forward
at a steady pace. For nearly a mile it ran with a
few bends due north, the bottom of it being smooth
and the sides perpendicular. Then the bed began
to rise with a gentle slope, until it eventually rose
to the level of the plain. Its width was in no place
more than ten yards across, and it had been formed
by some convulsion of nature that had caused the
surface to sink, and it looked as if it had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
gouged out of the earth. There are plenty of these
freaks of nature on the Taupo and Kaingaroa
plains, sometimes like the one I was in, accessible
at the ends, and others with precipitous sides all
round.</p>

<p>Well, I had just got to where the gradual slope
began when I heard a row behind me and, looking
round, saw over twenty natives riding as hard as
they could in pursuit. They were still some 300
yards away, and as soon as they saw I had spotted
them they started yelling like over-tortured fiends.
It was certainly time for me to hump myself, and
I increased my pace so as to put a greater distance
between us, while I rapidly thought out the best
plan to shake off this undesirable company. Had
I been on open ground I should have regarded the
contretemps with placidity, and perhaps have enjoyed
picking off a few of these howling sinners,
but, mixed up as I was among the network of vile
gullies, it was no joke, and the sun was on their
side of the hedge.</p>

<p>The only feasible plan I could think of, was to
follow the enemy&rsquo;s own tracks, as where they had
travelled with horses so could I, until I was clear
of these confounded gullies. You must remember
I was quite ignorant of this part of the country,
never having crossed the river before, and only
knowing that if I kept due north I should cut the
river; and on its banks was the Rat&rsquo;s Tooth I had
to find. The Hau Haus, on the other hand, would
know the country, and all the spots where they
could cross the gullies thoroughly, and would, of
course, try to cut me off. With these fiends in
pursuit I should have no time to look for crossing-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>places
whenever I came across a ravine, and I was
sure these existed as far as the range of hills,
which still extended for some miles on my left, ran.
Therefore I must follow the natives&rsquo; spoor, so as
to strike their crossing-places, and make use of
them. Of course I might fall in with a fresh gang
of Hau Haus, but I had to risk that; needs must
when the devil drives; and although I had not Old
Nick behind me in <i>propri&acirc; person&acirc;</i>, yet those who
were, so remarkably resembled him as to quite make
up by quantity any deficiency they lacked in quality.</p>

<p>I had not the least fear, bar accidents, of their
being able to catch me by riding me down, as
my hard-fed, splendid-conditioned horse for pace
and staying powers was far and away superior to
their half-starved, grass-fed nags; and even if they
had a good animal or two, looted from settlers,
among them, yet these would have so deteriorated
in their brutal hands as to be quite unfit to cope
with my gallant mount; besides, in a long chase, like
this might be, riding and handling would count a
lot, and even if one or two did press me I could
back my carbine against their guns, as a Maori is
a vile shot. All these thoughts passed through my
brain during the few minutes I was galloping
along the gully and gradually ascending to the
level of the plain. But Bobby Burns speaks the
truth when he remarks that the schemes of both
mice and men are liable to go crooked; for my
hastily and maybe well-thought-out plan was all
blown to blue blazes the moment I emerged from
the gully, as it was all I could do to swing my
horse to the right to prevent riding slap-bang into
a big gang of Maoris, some of whom were mounted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>This party were making for the entry I had
just left, for as I shot out of it the nearest of
them was within ten yards of me. They straggled
in a diagonal line, about 100 yards long, across to
what was evidently the outlet to another gully, as
in the hurried glance I took of them I saw a
horseman emerging as if from the ground. The
presence of these bounders, although not exactly
astonishing, was most undesirable, and I sent my
horse along, so as to escape nearer acquaintance
with them; nor did they seem to be quite pleased
with me, as they all started yelling like fiends, and
those who carried their fire-locks capped at once
fired them off in my direction, while with one
accord they all began to chase me.</p>

<p>It was high time for me to get out of that, but my
horse&rsquo;s pace soon carried me clear out of gun-shot
danger, and I quickly edged away to my left to try
and find, when I reached the gully, which I knew
must be close in that direction, a crossing-place, so
that I could get round the enemy&rsquo;s flank and still
carry out my duty. One thing I was sure of, the
Hau Haus would never give up the pursuit so long
as there was the ghost of a chance of catching me.</p>

<p>As I expected, I soon came to a ravine running
east, towards the river, and at the first glance saw
that it was a teaser. Over twenty feet in depth, its
sides, composed of hard pumice-stone, were quite
perpendicular and unnegotiable, even by a monkey.
I therefore had to continue along the brink, while
a loud, jeering yell made me understand that the
natives well knew there was no possibility of my
being able to cross it. I was annoyed, more than
annoyed, and I determined to solace myself by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
picking off one of the hilarious bounders, but
decided first of all to try the other flank. Letting
my horse go, I again crossed, diagonally, the
enemy&rsquo;s front, only to find myself, after a gallop
of not more than 400 yards, brought up by a
similar gully. Again the jeering yell broke out,
and I knew I was cornered between these infernal
ravines and the Waikato River.</p>

<p>I halted and turned so as to take a good look at
the pursuing Hau Haus, and determined to make it
hot for the leading man, but was sold again, as I
found they had extended in line between the two
ravines. They were over a hundred in number,
including at least forty mounted men, these latter
being scattered among the footmen, with the exception
of some eight or ten, who rode together about
a hundred yards in rear of the line, with the evident
intention of strengthening any part of it, should I
charge and try to break through. This for a
moment I thought of doing, but on looking towards
the spots where the only two outlets I knew of
were situated, I saw clumps of men stationed at
them, so I was convinced it was no use charging,
at least not at this period of the game.</p>

<p>The deliberate way the Hau Haus were advancing
showed me that they knew it was impossible
for me to break away to either flank, and that they
were systematically going to pen me up against
the river and try to capture me alive. This I
determined they should not do; somehow I was
convinced that my day had not yet come, and I
had such an inner conviction I was going to
wriggle out of my scrape that I felt quite easy
about myself and only anxious about my horse.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>The moment I halted the enemy began to poke
fun at me. One shouted: &ldquo;Get fins, like a fish, for
yourself and horse, then swim the river.&rdquo; Another
wag roared out: &ldquo;Grow wings like a pigeon and
fly back to your home.&rdquo; This was advice which,
although not solicited, could scarcely be called
rude. But another ribald ruffian was not only rude
but grossly personal, for, running out in front of the
line, he howled out, with the most insulting gestures:
&ldquo;Render yourself up to us; the women are making
ready the ovens, and I hunger for your flesh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I shouted back, and my voice carried far in those
days: &ldquo;You whose head is fit to be boiled&rdquo; (the
most awful insult in the Maori tongue), &ldquo;thou at
least shalt not partake of the feast; go feed on the
spirits of your fathers.&rdquo; The old sneider carbine,
though laughed at nowadays, was true up to 300
yards, and the Maori was not more than 200 yards
from me. He had just begun to make some nasty,
uncalled-for remarks when I proved the correctness
of my prophecy to him, by dropping him in
his tracks, thereby cutting short what might have
been a most eloquent oration.</p>

<p>A wild yell with a wilder volley answered my
shot, and the line made a kokiri (short charge)
in my direction. I only lingered long enough to
shout in Maori, &ldquo;I have caught the first man&rdquo; (a
most important and lucky omen in Maori warfare),
then turned and cantered away out of rifle-range, as
it would never do to have my horse wounded.</p>

<p>It was high time I should put on my considering
cap and think out the situation and my future
movements. It would have been far more to my
advantage had they followed me in a straggling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
mob, as then I could have picked off the leaders, and
it would have denoted anxiety, on their part, lest I
should find some possible crossing by which I could
escape; but the quiet, methodical way they were
going about their business showed me that they
considered my chance of getting away was nil, and
that they had made up their minds to risk nothing,
that the gullies could not be crossed, so that their
intention was to drive me before them to the river&rsquo;s
bank, and hive me there at their own convenience,
the river being uncrossable.</p>

<p>But halt! Was the river uncrossable? I
knew it to be a very dangerous one, even for such
swimmers as my horse and self, who together had
crossed many a bad river before; but I was also
aware that the natives&rsquo; great dread of it was caused
by superstitious nervousness, just as much as it was
caused by its actual dangers. Of course there were
very many parts of it quite impossible, but perhaps
I might find a place where a determined attempt
would have a chance of success. Anyhow I would
go and have a look at it.</p>

<p>The river was not more than three miles from
me and I cantered steadily towards it, so as not to
tire my horse, but still give me time to examine the
banks and select the best places to enter, and get
out of it, provided I should make up my mind to
risk the crossing.</p>

<p>It did not take me long to reach the bank, and I
rode along it from one gully to the other. Both of
these ran down to the water&rsquo;s edge, and the bank of
the river near both of them was fully twenty feet
high, and perpendicular; but half-way between them
was a natural depression in the plain, that ran at a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
gentle slope down to the bank, where it was only
four or five feet above the water, which was very
deep right up to the bank. This depression slanted
upstream, a point in my favour, and this was
evidently the place I must take-off from.</p>

<p>The river was indeed a noble one, quite 200 yards
broad, and evidently of great depth. Its enormous
volume of water, forcing itself along, confined by
the high banks, reminded me of a big fat boy
buttoned up tight in a suit of clothes far too small
for him, wriggling and writhing about, trying to
make them more comfortable.</p>

<p>I next turned my attention to the other side, to
see if I could spot a place up which we could
scramble. The far bank, though lower than the
one I was on, was still very steep, and I knew there
must be a great depth of water under it; but some
200 yards downstream the land ran out to a point,
and there was just the possibility of my horse finding
footing there. The current also seemed to set
from my side of the river towards this point, and if
so it would help me enormously. I tested this by
tearing off a branch from a bush and throwing it in,
when I saw it rapidly swept towards the spot I hoped
to make. The rate at which it was carried also gave
me some idea of the tremendous rush of water, the
surface of which seemed to writhe and winkle as if in
mortal anguish, while the numerous whirlpools informed
me what a furious undertow there must be.</p>

<p>Great was the risk we should run in attempting to
cross, yet under the circumstances I determined to
run it. I felt certain I was not going under that day,
and anyhow a clean death in the sweet, cool water
of the river was far preferable to being turned into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
long pig by my brutal pursuers. Then again they
might kill my horse and catch me with sufficient life
remaining in me to make it worth their trouble to
torture it out of me. No fear, I wanted none of
that; the river was my dart, especially as my old
nurse had always assured me of quite another kind
of death than drowning, and, sure, she was known
in my part of the world as a knowledgable woman.</p>

<p>The few minutes I had sat and watched the stream
at the taking-off place, I had talked to and explained
matters to my glorious horse. What&rsquo;s that you
say? a horse can&rsquo;t understand you? Rot! you taxi-cab,
motor-busing new chum. A horse you have
treated as a pal, and not as a slave, will understand
any simple matter you explain to him, far better
than the ordinary Englishman can understand the
beauties of tariff reform. Bear that in mind, you
mud-splashing, dust-creating greenhorn, if you ever
want to become worth your salt on the frontier.
Anyhow, my horse understood me, and I rode up
to the plain again.</p>

<p>The Hau Haus were not far off, and when they
saw me regain the level they evidently thought I
had funked the river and was going to try to escape
on terra firma, for they saluted me with loud
laughter and jeers. Unbuckling my wallet straps,
for I had them on my saddle, although I had left
the wallets themselves behind me, I carefully
fastened my carbine across the pommel of the
saddle and also crossed the stirrups. Then, as a
farewell to my pursuers, I shouted: &ldquo;O ye slaves
and dogs, I go to bathe in the Waikato; come with
me, if ye be not afraid.&rdquo; I turned my horse and,
gripping my saddle, with thighs and legs like a vice,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
I started at a canter down the slope, increasing my
pace and urging him on with my voice, until at last
we charged the river at full gallop. The noble
animal knew well what I expected from him, for as
soon as I gave him his head he pointed his ears and,
gathering himself together at every bound, without
a swerve, the slightest balk, or the least hesitation,
measured his take-off to a nicety, and leaped far out
into the air. I was quite prepared for the plunge.
I had twisted my hand well into his mane, and had
taken a deep breath as we made the spring. I felt
the rush through the air, and saw the shining water
below us, that seemed to rise and meet us, but I
felt no shock; for although we must have raised the
deuce of a splash, and must have sunk somewhat,
yet we seemed to come to the surface immediately,
and the first sensation I noticed was the current
tugging at me, as if trying to pull me out of my
saddle.</p>

<p>We had taken the water exactly as I hoped we
should do&mdash;that is, with the horse&rsquo;s head turned
well upstream&mdash;so that the tremendous force of the
current, although it swept us rapidly downstream,
yet carried us diagonally across it. My horse was
swimming deep but magnificently, and was not a
bit flurried or nervous, and although the current
kept tugging at me I had small trouble in retaining
my seat, while I eased him in every way I could,
talking to him and encouraging him the whole
passage. The crossing seemed to take but a very
short time, and I saw we should reach the bank
above the point. I was very glad of this, as the
current ran round the point like a mill sluice, and
I did not know how it set on the other side, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
what sort of a bank there was round it. We
neared the shore, and I turned the good nag&rsquo;s
head towards it, for him to make his effort, but
feared the water would be too deep, as although
the bank sloped, yet from the water it looked very,
very steep. Just as we reached it I felt the noble
animal give a tremendous heave, with a mighty
rearing plunge; his hind feet must have touched
bottom, for he landed with both fore feet on the
bank. Like a flash I was over his withers, taking
the reins with me, and scrambled to my feet on
the slope. It was with difficulty I could keep my
footing, but I managed somehow, and, tugging at
the reins, I shouted his name and encouraged him
all I knew. Gathering himself together, he made
another tremendous spring and, with me scrambling
in front of him, in a few bounds he reached the
top, where I lavished much praise and many endearments
on him, these being cut short by the
song of an Enfield bullet as it whistled over us; so
I led him under cover, loosed his girths, unbuckled
my carbine and returned at once to the bank. We
had crossed, they might try, and as I had had more
of their company than I desired, I intended my
carbine to dissuade them; I examined its breech
and found that, notwithstanding its bath, it was
in good working order, so that was all right. My
appearance was greeted with yells, a straggling
volley and a frantic war-dance. I never lack in
politeness, so, to return their compliments, I danced
a step or two myself, shouting, &ldquo;Come to me, come
to me&rdquo;; then, dropping to a prone position, I took
careful aim at a Johnny who was executing a <i>pas
seul</i>. My shot spoiled his performance, for he sat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
down suddenly and was quickly removed by his
friends.</p>

<p>I have heard that actors retire gracefully from
the stage when the gods express their disapproval
by heaving defunct cats and doubtful eggs at them,
but I should think they would greatly expedite
their movements if a man opened out with a carbine.
Yes, they would quickly leave a clear stage;
at least it was so in this case, as the company I
disapproved of, cutting their dances short, dispersed
in a moment, taking their wounded man with them,
and hastened in their exits by two more bullets,
both of which, I fancy, touched meat.</p>

<p>The Hau Haus having retired, I returned to
my horse, removed the saddle and gave him a
good rub-down with a handful of fern; then we
lunched together. His oats were none the worse
for their ducking, while my biscuits, if pulpy, were
palatable, and we enjoyed them. The sun quickly
dried me and we made for home. There was no
chance of reaching the Rat&rsquo;s Tooth from the side
I was on; besides, I considered it my duty to
inform my colonel of the presence of the Maoris.
Another thing, what were they doing there? I
suspected they had large plantations of potatoes
in that bush, and that when they blundered up
against me they were on their way to dig them up
and had brought their horses to carry them away
on. If my conjectures were right, I now knew
where to find them.</p>

<p>After a hard, scrambling journey over fern ridges
we reached the fort, and I reported to the colonel,
who babbled a bit at my failure to complete my
duty, but was quite pacified when I told him my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
conjectures about the potatoes. He was not an Irishman,
true, but he dearly loved a spud, and if my
ideas about them turned out correct, the capture
of these potatoes would be of enormous value to
us, as the Government were at their wits&rsquo; end how
to keep us and our horses supplied with rations,
while the loss of them, to the enemy, would be
very severe.</p>

<p>That night a strong force, on foot, under my
guidance, crossed the river and made for the big
gully where I had first seen the spoor. We made
a smart night&rsquo;s march, hoping to surprise the enemy
and catch them on the hop. In that we failed, their
outposts being well on the alert; but in the ensuing
skirmish we killed a few of them, captured all their
horses and an immense quantity of potatoes, large
numbers of these having been already dug up and
packed ready for transport, so that my friends the
Hau Haus had worked hard for nothing, except
our benefit, and I felt very pleased. Was I
spiteful? I wonder.</p>

<p>But somehow, now I have spun the yarn out,
something seems to have gone wrong with it; for
when I come to look at the heading it distinctly
states that the tale is to be a yarn about the Scout
that Failed. And now I come to think it over, I
was really not scouting at all, but only trying
to open communications with another column,
though to do that is certainly the work of a scout,
and I moreover was a scout, but yet I was not
scouting. Then as to Failure. Sure if I did fail
to find the Rat&rsquo;s Tooth, faith! I found the spuds.</p>

<p>Therefore the title is a misnomer or I&rsquo;ve put the
wrong yarn to the right title, or the wrong title to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
the right yarn, but anyhow, failure or not, you&rsquo;ve
the yarn, so digest it and make the best of it, as we
did the potatoes; and I assure you there was no
failure about them. And as now this finale has
bothered me as much as those confounded gullies
did, I must confess that after partaking of perhaps
too many of those spuds, and very good they were,
I broke out into poetry in honour of my glorious
horse. I will only give you one verse, so don&rsquo;t
run away:</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;A man may love a bow-wow, or a man may love a girl,<br />
He may prate on points of pedigree, or rave about a curl,<br />
But a trooper can love both of these, in a tiny way of course,<br />
For most of his affections are lavished on his horse.<br />
Oh, some men love a steamer yacht, and some love jaunting cars,<br />
And I hear that in a big balloon men soon will visit Mars;<br />
But here&rsquo;s a toast you all must drink, refuse it if you can,<br />
A health to the noble warhorse, God&rsquo;s greatest gift to man.&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t throw pannikins at me, but blame potatoes
and ration rum taken on an empty stomach. Good-night.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>SOME MIRACULOUS ESCAPES I HAVE KNOWN</small></h2>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a sweet little cherub who sits up aloft<br />
And looks after the life of poor Jack.&rdquo;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Dibdin.</span></span>
</p>


<p>By miraculous escapes I mean those escapes from
death that have been entirely engineered by the
Power above, who has preserved the life of human
beings when they were utterly helpless, and who,
for some inscrutable reason, saves one life and
allows others to be destroyed.</p>

<p>The yarns I am now going to spin will illustrate,
I think, what I have written above.</p>

<p>About midnight on 6th September 1868 a New
Zealand Field Force, under the command of
Colonel McDonnell, consisting of 200 white men
and 70 friendly natives, left camp, crossed the
deep, rapid and icy-cold River Waingongora, and
started to attack Tetokowaru in his stronghold
Te-ngutu-o-te-manu.</p>

<p>I am not going to inflict on you the miserable
yarn of the unfortunate fight, as I have written it
elsewhere; suffice it to say that the great majority
of the 200 white men were untrained new chums,
and that over 40 of them bolted at the first
volley. The remainder stood their ground,
although they refused to extend; so we lost one-third
of our number, killed and wounded, in less
than a quarter of an hour, and had to retreat, leaving
our dead and many wounded men behind us.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>So that you can understand the position of affairs,
I may tell you that Colonel McDonnell, retaining
the command of 100 of the white men, had sent
the remaining 100 under Major Von Tempsky, to
act on the right of his own party, and, as soon as
he saw that nothing but a retreat could save the
remainder of his force, he sent Captain McDonnell,
his brother, to Von Tempsky with orders for the
Major to retreat at once, and join up with his own
party.</p>

<p>This order was delivered, but a few seconds
later the Major was shot dead. Captain McDonnell
then gave the order to Captain Buck, who
promised to carry it out. Captain McDonnell
returned to his brother, and the retreat began.
Instead of immediately obeying the order, Captain
Buck endeavoured to recover the Major&rsquo;s body,
and was at once shot dead, without having passed
the order on to anyone else. The next senior officer,
Captain Roberts, took command of the party; but,
as he was ignorant of the order to retreat, he still
continued to hold his ground, until he was informed
by some of his men that the Colonel had retreated.
Joined by a few friendly natives, he retired by
another route, and led the remains of his shattered
and worn-out party into camp next morning.</p>

<p>Having given you a rough idea how things stood
with our men on the afternoon of the 7th (please
remember the date), I will now start the yarn.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when Captain
Roberts began his retreat, pursued by a party of
Hau Haus. His men, nearly all new chums,
behaved badly; but with a few good men, and
the friendly natives who had joined him, he kept<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
the enemy at bay till nightfall, when they drew
off.</p>

<p>Now among his party he had a man named Dore,
one of the Wellington Rangers, and a new chum.</p>

<p>This poor fellow had his arm, just below the
shoulder, smashed to pieces by a bullet, fell, fainted
from loss of blood, and was abandoned.</p>

<p>When he came to, he found himself stripped of
everything, with the exception of his tattered and
blood-stained shirt.</p>

<p>He must have been discovered by the pursuing
Hau Haus, who had evidently thought him dead,
but who, although they stripped him, forbore to
tomahawk him or mutilate his body. This in itself
was a marvel, and shows that that sweet little
cherub must have taken his case in hand, as, with
one other exception, the Hau Haus were never
known to omit tomahawking and mutilating a
dead body.</p>

<p>The poor chap hid in a hollow rata-tree, and
when it was quite dark attempted to find his way
back to camp. He, however, was a new chum,
knew nothing of bush work, and consequently lost
his way, wandering in a circle, and always returning
to the vicinity of the blood-stained pah and ferocious
Hau Haus. This he continued to do for three
days; but on the evening of the 10th he managed
to get out of the bush into the open country, and
made for the camp. All this time he had been
without a bite of food, with a severe raw wound,
with only the fragment of a shirt to protect him
against the icy-cold sleet and frost, and although
all that time in the close vicinity of the Hau Hau
pah, he miraculously escaped being spotted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>As I said before, on the evening of the 10th he
found himself in the open country, and struck out
for the drift across the flooded Waingongora River.
He remembered reaching it, then lost recollection.
How he crossed that drift, a very bad one even for
a strong and healthy man to tackle alone, is more
than a miracle; but he always asserted he was fired
on while doing so, and fainted on reaching the
bank.</p>

<p>Here he was only two miles from the camp; but
his mind became a blank, for he wandered about
till the evening of the 12th, when he was discovered
by a patrol, coming out of a clump of bush, and he
was brought into camp.</p>

<p>Now, just consider for a moment what this man
Dore went through, and what awful dangers he
escaped. Badly wounded and found by the most
savage fanatics on the earth, yet, against their
custom, they neither tomahawk nor mutilate him.
Then he wanders for over five days, through bitter
frost and cold, with an open and untended wound;
he escapes the notice of the enemy, crosses, while
weak from the loss of blood, starvation and pain, a
most dangerous river, and yet, when brought into
camp, his wound heals long before those of men
who are not nearly so badly hurt, and who have
not been through his awful experiences. You may
call it luck. I maintain it was the work of that
sweet little cherub, who, for his own reasons,
&ldquo;bossed up the whole show!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In many of my yarns I have mentioned the
massacre at Poverty Bay that was engineered by
that arch-devil, Te Kooti, and his gang of fiends,
called Hau Haus. On 10th July 1868 Te Kooti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
and some 200 Hau Haus landed at Whare-onga-onga,
having escaped from the Chatham Islands.
They had overpowered the guard there, seized the
schooner <i>Rifleman</i>, forced the crew to sail them to
Poverty Bay, and had landed some fifteen miles south
of the white settlements. Owing to the criminal
negligence of the Government, who, because they
wished for peace, persuaded themselves they had got
it, the defence force had been disbanded, and even
the arms and ammunition removed from the adjacent
districts, so that the settlers were almost
helpless, while Te Kooti was soon joined by all
the restless fanatics in the country.</p>

<p>Major Biggs, who was in charge of the Poverty
Bay district, made head against Te Kooti, with
whatever men and arms he could scrape together,
but with small success. He was also guilty of an
unpardonable piece of folly, as he allowed the
settlers to remain on their scattered homesteads,
and delayed collecting them together for mutual
support, although warned to do so by friendly
natives, who offered to assist in building defensive
works. For this delay he paid dearly, as he and
the whole of his family were surprised and, with
the exception of one boy, brutally murdered. It
was on the night of 9th November that Te Kooti
made his raid on Poverty Bay. On that night
Captain Wilson, second in command, was sitting
in his house writing, when a party of Hau Haus,
under a fiend called Nama, knocked at the door
and informed him they had a letter for him from
Hirini-Te-Kani, the head chief of the district.
The Captain, however, had his suspicions, and told
them to pass the letter under the door, at the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
time arming himself and calling his servant Moran
to come to his assistance. Moran slept in an outhouse;
but he succeeded in breaking through the
enemy, and joined his master. The Hau Haus,
seeing they could not deceive the Captain, tried to
force the door open with the trunk of a tree. The
Captain at once opened fire on them, and forced
them to drop it; so they then set fire to the house.</p>

<p>The white men fought on until the house was in
full flare, when Captain Wilson accepted the Hau
Hau offer of life for himself and family, provided
he surrendered. It was a choice of that, or being
all burned alive; and as there was a slight possibility
of the Hau Haus keeping their promise, Captain
Wilson surrendered.</p>

<p>Carrying a little boy in his arms, and followed by
his wife and Moran, with the other children, three
in number, if I remember rightly, they were surrounded
by the Hau Haus, who led them towards
the river. <i>En route</i> he asked one of the natives
where they were being taken to, and was at once
shot, from behind, through the back.</p>

<p>Staggering to a bit of manuka scrub, the Captain
threw the child into it, telling him to run, and in
the confusion the youngster was not noticed and
hid in the scrub. At the same moment Moran
was tomahawked, and Mrs Wilson and the children
were savagely treated, bayoneted and left for dead.
The children were dead, but Mrs Wilson still
lived.</p>

<p>Te Kooti and his gang remained in the settlement
till the morning of the 14th&mdash;mark the date&mdash;plundering
and murdering all the women and
children who had escaped the night of the 9th,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
and whom his men found in hiding. On the afternoon
of the 16th a small patrol from Tauranganui
visited the blood-stained settlement and found
little James Wilson hidden with a dog in his arms.
The boy told them how he was trying to get to
Tauranganui to bring help for his mother, who was
lying wounded in an outhouse at their late home,
but he had lost his way. As well as he could, poor
child, he also described his miraculous escape.</p>

<p>He had hid in the scrub, but next day came
back to the spot where his family had been
murdered. Here he found the bodies of his father,
his brothers, his sister and Moran, but not that of
his mother.</p>

<p>He had then wandered back to his old home,
hiding whenever he saw anyone, and there, in an
outhouse, had found his mother lying dreadfully
wounded.</p>

<p>The patrol went on to the house and found the
poor lady in a dreadful state, but quite conscious.
She told them that after the murder of her husband
and children she had been most brutally ill-treated
and then left for dead. When she came to herself
she struggled back to what had been her home,
and had taken refuge in an outhouse, where she
had been found by her little son, who had kept
her alive by scouting for hens&rsquo; eggs or anything
else he could find.</p>

<p>Now I call the escape of that child miraculous.
For a helpless youngster to get away in the first
place is wonderful; but that he should have been
successful in evading the Maori search, of five
days, for stragglers, and after finding his mother,
to have been able to feed himself and her for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
seven days, with the food he scouted for, is a bit
more than miraculous, and I put it down entirely
to that sweet little cherub who sits up aloft.</p>

<p>Mrs Wilson and her son were removed to
Tauranganui and afterwards to Napier. For nine
days after she had been found it was hoped she
might recover, but her injuries were too great, and
she died shortly after she reached the latter place.</p>

<p>The above short and very incomplete yarn may
give you some idea of the reason why we, members
of the Lost Legion, so cheerfully underwent the
great hardships we did to revenge the Poverty Bay
massacre of November 1868.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Folly, Pluck and Endurance</span></p>

<p>It is wonderful what a great number of good
scouts and men have jeopardised and even lost
their lives and the valuable information they have
obtained, by a small act of folly, or by refusing
to endure hardships for a few hours longer, when
by doing so they might have won through safely
and have brought to their O.C. the information
he so badly wanted.</p>

<p>I have known men who, despite years of experience,
have rushed out of their camp to tackle a
lion with only the one cartridge that was in their
rifle; and there are plenty of men who go prospecting
or even big-game hunting and have their
rifle and ammunition carried for them by a Kafir
boy. Trouble comes, the boy bolts, and they are
in a mess. Again, I have known men throw away
ammunition and rations, rather than endure the
fatigue of carrying them on the line of march,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
and how often has not a night&rsquo;s march or a premeditated
attack on an enemy&rsquo;s position been spoilt
by some man lighting his pipe or letting off his
rifle that he has been told to carry unloaded?</p>

<p>The yarn I am going to spin you now will
perhaps bear out what I have just written, and
though the man who committed the folly extricated
himself by a deed of heroism never surpassed
and seldom equalled, yet the act of folly
he and his mate perpetrated might have led to the
loss of three lives, their own included.</p>

<p>It was in November 1865. The Hau Haus
(fanatical and rebel Maoris) had received a severe
defeat at the hands of the Colonial forces and
friendly natives at Waerenga-a-Hika, which so
broke them up that they were unable to face the
music in that district (Poverty Bay) for a few years.</p>

<p>Over 400 of them had surrendered. Of these
some 200 had been transported to the Chatham
Islands, the remainder settling down peacefully
for a long time. There were, however, still a large
number of the most fanatical and bloodthirsty of
the savages who, although unable to make a stand,
yet roved about the country in small bands, seeking
opportunity to destroy any white man or friendly
native whom they might come across.</p>

<p>Now among the Defence Force, scattered at
posts built for the protection of the settlers, was
a big, raw-boned Irish sergeant named Walsh, who
had heard very many extraordinary yarns about
some petroleum springs at a place called Pakake-a-Whirikoka,
situated some thirty miles from the
post he was in charge of. I do not know what
his reasons were; perhaps it was only curiosity,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
or perchance he had ideas of becoming an oil king.
But as things looked quiet and peaceful, he determined
to visit them, and persuaded an old settler
and his son, named Espic, to guide him to the
locality.</p>

<p>Well, they started early in the morning, the time
being summer and the weather very hot, and after
a long ride of nearly thirty miles reached the steep
hill leading to the springs. Here they dismounted,
and, because they had seen no signs of the enemy,
decided to leave their horses in charge of the boy,
while they went up the hill, on foot, to examine
the springs.</p>

<p>This in itself was an act of folly; but they went
one worse, for, the weather being hot, and meaning
only to be absent a very short time, they left their
carbines, coats and all their ammunition at the
foot of the hill, rather than endure the slight trouble
of carrying them, and started the ascent with only
their revolvers.</p>

<p>Now they had been spotted by one of these
bands of Hau Haus, who, as soon as they saw the
two white men go up the hill, crawled up to the
horses and captured them, with the arms and
ammunition. The boy, however, although fired at,
escaped and got away. The Hau Haus, thinking
they had their prey secure, tied up the horses to
a tree, and went up the hill after the white men,
who, having heard the shots, were returning.</p>

<p>As soon as they met, the natives fired a volley,
which broke Espic&rsquo;s arm and wounded Walsh on
the forehead and hand. The white men returned
the fire, and in the skirmish that followed Walsh
was again wounded and, the white men&rsquo;s revolvers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
being now empty, the Hau Haus, nine in number,
rushed them with the tomahawk, to finish them off.</p>

<p>In the hand-to-hand scrap that ensued Walsh
was again twice wounded; but he still fought on,
and a Hau Hau, determining to finish him, put his
cut-down gun to Walsh&rsquo;s chest and fired.</p>

<p>Fortunately the bullet must have fallen out of
the gun, as Walsh only sustained a bad burn on
the chest. Springing in, he felled his assailant
with a tremendous blow from the butt-end of his
revolver. This was too much for Maori superstition.
That a man whom they had badly wounded
five times should be able to continue to put up a
fight was bad enough; but that he should be able
to floor their best man just after that best man had
shot him through the chest was more than any
decent Hau Hau could understand. Leaving the
horses and the stricken man behind them, away
they fled, only too anxious to put as great a
distance as they could between themselves and the
awful tohunga (magician), who refused to be
killed. So much for folly and pluck. Now I will
go on to endurance.</p>

<p>No sooner had the astonished and affrighted
Hau Haus bolted than Walsh and his mate kicked
their prisoner into convalescence and proceeded
down the hill, where they found their horses tied
to a tree, but the carbines, ammunition, and even
saddles, taken away. Both men were badly
wounded, Walsh in five places; but he would
neither kill his prisoner nor let him go. Passing
a rope round his neck, they made shift to mount
their horses, bare-backed, and, forcing him to accompany
them, they led him that long, hot ride of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
thirty miles, back to Tauranganui, where they
arrived that night. Yes, faint though they were
with the loss of blood, racked with the pain of
untended wounds, without a round of ammunition,
and hampered by an evil brute of a Hau Hau,
who did everything in his power to retard their
progress. Yet they would neither kill him nor
let him go.</p>

<p>That I think is a yarn that illustrates folly, pluck
and endurance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>A TOUGH SWIM IN BAD COMPANY</small></h2>


<p>If you look at the map of the middle island of New
Zealand you will see the north coast of it, washed
by Cook&rsquo;s Straits, is deeply indented by fiords
running inland, and that Tory Channel and Queen
Charlotte&rsquo;s Sound are two of the principal ones.</p>

<p>These run in separately for some miles, and then
join together and form one sound, which continues
for a considerable distance, having on one side,
some miles farther south, the important seaport of
Picton.</p>

<p>The island, surrounded by the water of the
aforementioned fiords, is known as Alapawa or
Arapawa Island, and in the year 1872 was divided
into two sheep runs and occupied by two firms of
squatters who had already acquired a large number
of sheep.</p>

<p>The scenery up these fiords is magnificent, the
densely bushed mountains coming down to the
water, which is deep to the very shore, so much
so that the largest ship can sail close in and, if her
skipper wants to, can make fast to the big trees
growing down to the water&rsquo;s edge. The tide runs
up and down these fiords at a tremendous rate, and
this must be remembered when you read the yarn
I am now going to spin you.</p>

<p>Arapawa Island is a range of high mountains,
and on the side facing Queen Charlotte&rsquo;s Sound<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
I was staying at one of the sheep stations for the
purpose of recuperating my health after a rather
long spell in hospital.</p>

<p>The year before I had foolishly got in the way
of a small piece of lead that, being in a hurry, was
travelling very fast. I had stopped it, and had
been punished for my imprudence by having to
lay up while doctors sunk shafts and drove drives
in my corpus and generally prospected me for a
lead mine.</p>

<p>True, they had not struck the reef; but then they
had not succeeded in killing me, and when I got
out of their hands I called it a drawn game, and
started to get well in my own way.</p>

<p>The shafts and the drives had filled up, and I
had finished the cure by staying two months in
the glorious climate of the sounds, first knocking
about in a sailing-boat in the management of which
I was a dab, and then assisting my friends by
running over the hills after sheep. This exercise,
with plenty of good mutton and damper, turning-in
just after dark, and turning-out just before sunrise,
had perfected my cure, and I was as strong as ever,
and in good training. At that time I neither used
spirits nor tobacco; I was as hard as iron and as
tough as whipcord, and had, moreover, practised
swimming, boxing, fencing and other gymnastics
from early childhood. The awful hardships of the
past wars had done me no harm, but rather good,
as they had squeezed the last soft drop out of me,
and I was fit for anything.</p>

<p>I should have rejoined my troop on the frontier
of the North Island a fortnight before, but waited to
help my friends through with their yearly mustering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
and sheep-shearing. Hands were scarce, and I had
never before seen a muster or sheep-shearing, so,
my traps having been sent on to Picton, I waited
for it. Well, the shearing was over and the men
temporarily taken on for it were paid off.</p>

<p>In those days, on the last night before the extra
hands were dismissed it was considered the right
thing to do for everyone to go on a big burst, and
men who had worked hard for weeks, and not
touched a drop of spirits, would get blind drunk.
So it was at this station, with the exception
of myself, who did not touch grog; all hands,
masters and men, had a tremendous burst, drinking
up every drop of strong rum laid in for the
occasion.</p>

<p>The following morning at daylight I started for
Picton in a boat, accompanied by one of the partners
and four of the extra hands, all of whom were what
is known as suffering a recovery, which means they
were very ill from the effects of the previous night&rsquo;s
debauch. I had roused them up, got the boat out,
and we started on as lovely a morning as I ever saw
in my life. My crew, very ill and sulky, lay down
in the bottom of the boat, a roomy craft of about
twenty-three feet in length, and tried to sleep.</p>

<p>Well, we made our offing, the sun rose very hot
and the wind died away. It was by this time slack
water, and, as the men refused to pull an oar, we
lay motionless. Suddenly I noticed the day darken
and the mountains of Arapawa Island covered with
a dense black cloud that was rolling rapidly down
them, and knew in a moment we were in for a
southerly buster.</p>

<p>The air grew rapidly colder, and I shouted to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
the men to get up and shorten sail; but they would
not move. I saw what resembled a dense cloud
of dust raised off a very dry road in summer-time
coming at us. In a moment it was on us; it was
a spray torn from the sea by the force of the squall,
and it stung and blinded me. As the squall struck
us broadside on, it simply sunk us, turning us over
at the same time.</p>

<p>I stuck to the tiller until the boat turned turtle,
when I was, of course, thrown out, and was swimming
at her stern as the keel rose from the water. The
boat had a very deep false keel, and I saw that
everyone had got hold of it. Just as the squall
was thinning the boat rolled over and righted herself,
and in the lull I shouted to the men to leave
go their hold on the gunwale and join me, so that
we could try and swing the stern to the wind, when
perhaps one man could get in and bail her out.
But they would not listen. They all tried to
scramble into her at once, and over she went again.
This happened twice, and I could not get the
men to obey me, or try to do anything to save themselves.
They all seemed to be mad with fright;
one even kicked savagely at me as I tried to get
him to leave go his hold on the keel. I saw the
only chance to save my own and their lives was
to try to swim ashore, and get help and another
boat from the station.</p>

<p>I had at least two miles to swim; and that in the
teeth of a southerly buster, which I could see was
now coming on in full force. I was dressed only in
a thin flannel shirt and trousers; the latter I easily
tore off, but I determined to keep on my canvas
shoes, as I would have a long run round the beach<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
to get to the house&mdash;that is to say, if I ever got on
shore. This was very problematical, as not only
had I the gale to contend against, but I knew the
bay and sound swarmed with sharks; and the
evening before I had sat on a rock and shot at the
brutes as they were tearing to pieces the bodies of
a lot of old and worthless sheep that had been
killed and thrown into the sea.</p>

<p>Well, the sharks would have their chance at me
now, and turn and turn about is only fair play. In
tearing my trousers off I sank a bit, and on coming
up I shouted to the men I would try to bring
them help, and started. Just then down came the
true gale. The wind rushing through the tops of
the mountains struck the water as if forced through
a funnel, and tore it into foam and spray, which
not only blinded me, but simply drove me under
the water, and I quickly saw I must dodge the
fierce blasts by diving. I was a very powerful
swimmer and had the lungs and wind of an ostrich,
so that, whenever I saw a cloud of water dust
coming at me, down I went and swam under water
for all I was worth. Then, when I had to come
up for air, if there was a lull in between the squalls,
I would strike out with a good long side-stroke,
and make all the way I could.</p>

<p>This sort of thing went on for a long time, and
I thought of and used every dodge I had ever
learned or heard of to save my strength and use
it to the very best advantage. My long experience
in scouting and despatch-riding had trained me to
think quickly and to act decisively. I was as cool
as a cucumber and as hopeful as a boy setting out
to rob an orchard. The water was warm. I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
in splendid fettle, and I had a wild feeling of elation,
as I dodged the squalls, that was simply grand,
although my eyes ached and smarted with the
spray. If it had not been for the danger of my
helpless mates I should have simply revelled in
my struggle against the elements. As I rose for
air, during a lull, I took a good look at the land,
and was surprised at the very rapid progress I was
making.</p>

<p>For a minute I could not understand it. I was
certainly drawing more under the lee of the land,
and the squalls were not so fierce as at the first
start, but still I was quite a mile off, and they were
bad enough; but all at once I understood what
was befriending me; it was the tide.</p>

<p>It had been slack water when the accident had
happened, and the tide had turned and was simply
helping me all it knew; now I felt certain of getting
ashore, bar accidents. Yet, bar accidents, I was all
right; but there were other things also, as I quickly
discovered, for when I determined it was no longer
necessary for me to dodge the squalls, and had
settled down to a long, steady side-stroke, I glanced
to my right, and there, not thirty feet from me, was
a long, triangular fin sticking out of the water,
which I knew belonged to a shark of the largest
size. Instinctively I turned to the left. There
was another one; and as I raised myself in the
water and looked astern of me, there was a third.</p>

<p>To say I was in a funk is not to tell the truth;
funk does not fully describe my feelings. I knew
what funk was; I had been in a funk before, plenty
of times. I had been in many a tight and hot
corner before. I had often looked at what might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
be certain death, but then I had weapons in my
hand and the prospect of a good fight before I
went under; but now I was helpless. There was
to be no fight, there could be no fight. I had
not even a knife, and had I possessed one I was
outnumbered and outclassed.</p>

<p>As I trod water for a few moments I knew what
real fear was. I had never felt it before, and,
thank heaven! I have never felt it since. I can&rsquo;t
describe my feelings, and I would not if I could.
Certainly it was not the fear of death that caused
these sensations; but it seemed so hard that I, who
had almost overcome my danger, should be turned
into long pig for a beastly shark.</p>

<p>But my cowardice did not last long. I was still
at least three-quarters of a mile from shore; the
good tide was still sweeping me in, and my wild
Irish blood all at once boiled up in me. My duty
to myself and mates required me to get on shore,
and get on shore I would. If a shark took me,
well and good, kismet. Stick to my work I would,
shark or no shark; so I fell into my stroke, and
swam as if there had not been a shark within a
degree of latitude of me, escorted by a guard of
honour I never want again.</p>

<p>Yes, I got ashore, those d&mdash;d sharks keeping
company all the way; and when my foot hit bottom
and I stumbled through the shallow water and fell
on the sand there they still were, cruising about,
not a stone&rsquo;s-throw away, as if they were the most
harmless beasts in the ocean. Why did they not
go for me? I don&rsquo;t know; certainly my time had
not yet come, kismet. As soon as I had taken
a few breaths I looked for the boat, but could not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
see her for the dense spray which the gale, now at
its worst, was kicking up; so I started to run the
four miles round the bay to the station. The
rough beach and rocks soon cut my soaked shoes
to pieces and, as the soles became detached, I had
to run with bare feet, and suffered awfully. Fain
would I have halted and rested, but my mates&rsquo;
danger spurred me on, and I ran as if a Maori,
with his tomahawk, were after me.</p>

<p>I came to the head of the bay and suddenly
remembered that between me and the house there
was another very deep indent of the sea. At the
mouth it was not more than 250 yards across, but
it ran very far inland, and with my feet in the
state they were it would take me hours to get
round. No, I must swim it; and I was just
plunging in, notwithstanding the squalls, which
were tearing the surface of the water into dust,
when I was struck with the horrid thought of
sharks, and for a moment I paused like a coward
on the brink.</p>

<p>It was only for a moment. Curse the sharks!
my mates were on the boat; and in I went and
crossed after a hard swim. To get to the house,
rouse up the other partner and the one remaining
man, and to get out a small whale-boat did not
take many minutes. We manned the boat, peaked
the oars and ran before the gale. We came up
to the derelict in mid-sound, rolling over and over,
but not a sign of a man was on her, nor was a
single body ever found. We ran across the sound,
beached the boat, and, when the gale subsided,
pulled back.</p>

<p>This is, I think, the nearest call I have ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
had, and if there is any moral in my yarn it is
to leave drink alone, keep in training, do your
duty by yourself and mates, and trust to your
luck while doing so. Since then I have always
hated sharks. The curse of Cromwell be on
them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>HELD UP BY A BUSHRANGER</small></h2>

<p>(<i>Told by the Old Identity</i>)</p>


<p>It took place in the early seventies. I was in
Australia, and was temporarily in command of a
body of Mounted Police, doing duty as gold escort&mdash;a
very necessary precaution in those days. On
one occasion I was travelling up-country, accompanied
by four troopers, when a big squatter,
a friend of mine, asked leave to ride with my small
party, as he was carrying a quantity of gold up-country
with him to his station. Of course I was
delighted to have his company, and we set out.</p>

<p>All along the road there were plenty of shaves
(rumours) of bushrangers, but for three days we
never saw one. At noon on the fourth day we
halted at a bush shanty to feed, water and rest our
horses.</p>

<p>The bush shanties, in those days, were as a
rule vile poison shops, the owners and their
employees being usually hand in glove with every
scoundrel, cattle thief and bushranger in the
country, giving them information as to the movements
of the police, and in many cases sharing
with them their plunder.</p>

<p>However, with a party like ours there was
nothing to fear, at least so I thought; so when we
dismounted and handed over our horses to the
troopers to lead to the stockyards, some little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
distance from the house, myself and my friend
entered. It was a long, one-roomed building, with
a bar running the whole length of it, and the only
door at one end.</p>

<p>There was no one inside but the bar-tender,
as hang-dog-looking a ruffian as I have ever set
eyes on. Foolishly, as it proved, as I entered I
unbuckled my belt with sword and revolver
attached and threw them on a bench by the door.
Then we strolled together to the far end of the
bar and, hot and thirsty with our long ride in the
burning sun, called for drinks.</p>

<p>Glasses in hand, we stood with our backs to
the door, and were just about to sample our poison
when we heard the ominous words: &ldquo;Bail up!&rdquo;
Turning round, I saw a wicked-looking devil
standing in the doorway.</p>

<p>He had me covered with the heavy revolver
he carried in his right hand, while its mate, ready
for action, was gripped in his left by his side.</p>

<p>He was a well-made, tough-looking chap, very
muscular and strong, without carrying an ounce of
superfluous flesh, and dressed in the ordinary up-country
dress. His face, clean-shaven, was covered
by a black mask, but I noticed a well-cut mouth,
a determined chin, and his eyes gleamed through
the holes of his visor with a glint there was no
mistaking, while the hand that held the gun was
as steady as a rock.</p>

<p>Then I realised that he was between me and my
weapons, which lay on the bench by the door.</p>

<p>A man who has passed years in bush-fighting,
scouting and despatch-riding thinks quickly and
acts decisively. Had there been the slightest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
tremor in wrist or lips I should have slung my
glass at him, and risked a rush; but there was not
a sign of a tremble, and I knew that the slightest
hostile movement on my part would not only lead
to my certain death, but would be quite useless.</p>

<p>My friend and the villainous bar-tender, the latter
with a broad grin on his ugly mug, had at once
bailed up, and as there was no chance of help from
my troopers, who by that time must have off-saddled
and be attending to the horses at the stock-yard,
some way off, I knew we were cornered and
beaten.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; said the bounder, &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ve got
you. Bail up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you d&mdash;&mdash;d first,&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you,&rdquo; he retorted, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m on the
shoot. Sling your money on the counter, and&rdquo;&mdash;this
to my friend&mdash;&ldquo;sling that bag down too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The squatter was standing with his hands above
his head, so evidently could not do so, and the
bushranger said to me: &ldquo;Captain, sling that bag
over here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rot!&rdquo; was my discourteous reply; so he
turned to the blackguard behind the bar, who
was probably in league with him, and said, &ldquo;Joe,
you do it.&rdquo; And the bag was promptly thrown to
him.</p>

<p>Then he said to me, and I noticed he changed
his voice, dropping the Yankee slang and idiom
he had previously used, and speaking with a
well-modulated and refined accent: &ldquo;Captain, I
don&rsquo;t want anything from you.&rdquo; (This was just as
well, as I had nothing.) &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;how long start will you give me?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>I said: &ldquo;Five minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Word of honour?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So long.&rdquo; And with that he backed out, and in
a moment I heard the beat of a horse&rsquo;s hoofs starting
at a gallop. My friend was raving mad, and
wanted me at once to alarm my troopers, but I
said: &ldquo;No; you&rsquo;d got your gun with you just now,
why did you not use it?&rdquo; When five minutes had
passed I gave the order to saddle up; but of course
the man had got clear away. I never knew who
he was, but a man shot shortly afterwards by one
of my troopers was believed to be he, and most
probably was.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

<small>ON THE SCOUT IN NEW ZEALAND</small></h2>

<p>(<i>Told by the old Kai Tongata</i>)</p>


<p>It was in June 1869 that Te Kooti, chief of the
rebel Hau Haus, caught a party of mounted
volunteers on the hop, at a place called Opepe, on
the high plateau near Lake Taupo. The men,
worn out by a long march, and soaked through by
the cold winter rain and sleet, had taken shelter
on some old whares (huts) and were trying to dry
themselves when a few Maoris came up, and,
declaring themselves to be friendlies, joined them
at their fires.</p>

<p>More and more of them gradually arrived, until
the volunteers were outnumbered, and then, on
a signal being given, the natives sprang on
their unsuspecting victims, and the tomahawk
did the rest. The victors did not stay long at
the blood-stained spot. They knew that Colonel
McDonnell, Colonel St John and, worse than
anyone, Major Ropata Te Wahawaha, with
his friendly Ngatiporou, were not far away, and
that it behoved them to hump themselves and
travel before the avengers could reach them.
Some of the volunteers had escaped, and two of
them joined up with Colonel St John&rsquo;s column,
with which I was serving, the same evening as the
massacre took place.</p>

<p>It was at once boot and saddle, and before nightfall
we had marched to Opepe.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>Colonel St John had reached the spot before us,
in fact the men cut up belonged to his column, and
he had only left them the morning of the massacre
to rest themselves and horses, while he went on
to visit a Maori chief about ten miles away.</p>

<p>Next morning we were on the spoor, and
followed it through rough pumice-stone gullies for
some miles, in pouring rain and sleet, then lost all
trace of them in a dense scrub of manuka bush, so
we returned to Opepe for the night.</p>

<p>The following day it was determined to send scouts
out to find where the enemy had retreated to.</p>

<p>We had followed Te Kooti since July 1868,
when he had escaped with 160 fighting men from
Chatham Islands, had landed at Whare-onga-onga,
close to Poverty Bay, and had gathered all the
disaffected Maoris in the country to him. He
had sacked Poverty Bay, murdering about ninety
helpless settlers. He had fought us twice at
Makaretu and innumerable other places, had captured
a convoy of ammunition, had fortified himself
at Ngatapa, where he had repulsed, with heavy
loss, two assaults and had only evacuated the pah
when starved out for want of food and water.
And although we had, in the pursuit, captured
and killed 136 of his men, yet he himself escaped
and reached the fastnesses of the Uriwera country.</p>

<p>In April 1869 he had swooped down on the
Mohaka settlement and had murdered in cold blood
seventy whites and friendly natives, and then
retreated to Taupo country with us at his heels.</p>

<p>In fact he had kept us lively for a year, and was
going to prevent us getting rusty for two more,
until, having lost nearly all his men, he retired into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
the King country, where we could not follow him;
and he lived there quietly for twenty years, and at
last died in the odour of sanctity, highly respected
by all who knew him. For nearly four
years we were on his track: his escapes were
numerous and miraculous, we destroyed band after
band of the desperate savages who joined him, but
although he was wounded twice we never got
him.</p>

<p>Bad luck to it, I&rsquo;m off the spoor. To get back.</p>

<p>It was determined to send out scouts to locate
Te Kooti, and I was chosen with two men to do
the job. It was a big contract to handle. One
glance at the map will show you Lake Taupo. We
were at the north-east corner, about ten miles from
the semi-friendly pah at Tapuacharuru (Sounding
Footsteps), our base was at Opotiki, eighty miles
away, on the Bay of Plenty coast. There were at
that time no roads, no bridle-tracks, no paths; no
game existed in New Zealand, and there was no
food to be procured for man, and but little for
horses.</p>

<p>No white man, with the exception, perhaps, of
a stray missionary, had ever penetrated to that
part of the country, which was composed of dense
bush, mountains and broken ground covered with
manuka scrub, or long fern, which grew from six
to ten feet high, and it was in the depth of winter,
bitterly cold and wet. The enemy had retreated
in the direction of the great volcanoes Ruapehu
and Tongeriro, at the south-east end of the lake,
about thirty-five miles from where we were camped,
and in an awful country, quite unknown and hostile
to us. This country had to be searched, Te Kooti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
found and attacked before he established himself
in another stronghold and recruited his murderous
band of bloodthirsty savages. The columns could
not advance and look for him; they had no food to
feed man or horse during the time it would take to
find him. No, they must fall back nearer the base,
and the scouts must find him, and then the troops
and horses, well fed, could make a rush for him and
perhaps put an end to his career. My orders were
that I was to find Te Kooti and return to Opepe,
the Colonel promising he and the column would
meet me there on the sixteenth day, when I was to
guide him up to the quarry.</p>

<p>How I was to find the bounder, and how we were
to live while we were looking for him, was left to
me. It was certain that Te Kooti would be looking
out for anyone who might be impudent enough to
look for him, and if he caught us our fate was
certain, though, of course, we could only guess at
the nature of the torture to which we should be
subjected. Even if we were lucky enough to be
able to blow our own brains out before we were
captured, the Colonel would lose the information
he required, and more men would have to be
sent; so that it behoved us to keep ourselves and
our tracks hidden, and to see without being seen.</p>

<p>How we were to live I left to Providence; it
was beyond me. We were all hardened bushfighters,
and we must take our chance.</p>

<p>My two companions were queer characters; both
of them had been sailors: one of them, Pierre De
Feugeron, a Frenchman, the other a Kantuarius
Greek. They had been mates for years, were both
splendid scouts, expert bushmen, good shots, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
utterly fearless. Well, no sooner had I got my
orders than we started. Our field kit consisted of
smasher hats, dark blue serge jumpers that reached
to the knee, but during the day were drawn up
and fastened round the waist; we wore no trousers,
but had shawls round us like kilts. I wore shooting
boots and socks; the others went barefooted with
sandals. Our arms consisted of carbines and
revolvers, and we each wore in our belts a tomahawk
and sheath knife. On our backs we carried
a blanket rolled up, in which was some very bad
bacon and worse biscuit, four pounds of each; and
with this we were to penetrate thirty-five miles or
more into an unknown country, as rough as any in
the world, find a wily enemy and, above all, get
back with our information.</p>

<p>It may not seem much to the man who has never
been out of Britain, but a Colonial will appreciate
the job at its true value.</p>

<p>We left the camp from the north side, and made
a wide detour to the north-east, before we struck
to the south-west, to touch the lake. The enemy
had retreated almost due south, through a number
of rough pumice-stone gullies, and it was more than
likely that a sly old bird like Te Kooti would
leave an ambush on his spoor to cut off any scouts
that might be sent after him, or, in case a strong
party followed him, to give him news of their movements.
I did not want to fall into that ambush.
I had been in a few before, and did not like them;
and so went round to try and cut his spoor a good
way south of where we had abandoned it on the
previous day.</p>

<p>All that day we tramped across deep gullies and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
through manuka scrub, very often having to head
off our road to examine the ground on either side
of us, and to take bearings to our rear as well as to
our front.</p>

<p>A good scout should always do this, as he may
have to return a sight faster than he went; and
he must remember which way he came; he has no
time to think much when a war party is after him.</p>

<p>Well, as night fell we came to a range of
mountains covered with bush, and I reckoned that,
with our detour, we had made quite ten miles to the
south of Opepe, and were well on our way. It had
rained all day, except when it sleeted, and of course
we were wet through, yet we dare not light a fire.
For all we knew we might have been spotted and
followed; so we entered the bush, and as soon as
it was quite dark moved carefully a mile away and,
eating a small handful of biscuits, wrapped ourselves
in our shawls and blankets and slept as well as we
could.</p>

<p>It froze hard that night and the cold was intense;
in the morning we were up as soon as a glimmer
of day came, and started to cross the range of
mountains. The bush was a regular New Zealand
one, composed of trees of gigantic size, and with a
dense undergrowth that nothing but a pig or an
elephant could get through. We therefore had to
take to the bed of a creek and follow it up to the
ridge. The water was icy cold, and the cold drip
from the trees and bushes wet us through, although
it did not rain. With nothing but a few bits of
flint-like biscuit to chew, up we went, and came to
the top of the range, and there we rested and got a
view of the country.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>To our west was the lake, and to the south was
the cone of Tongeriro and the three peaks of
Ruapehu; between us and them was range after
range of hills, below us lay a deep valley, and, tough
as we were, I almost feared the job was too tough
for us. To despond is one of the last things a
scout should do; so after more biscuit off we went
again, and, striking another creek, we descended
the bed of it till we came to the river that ran
through the valley and entered the lake at the foot
of it. I determined to descend the bed of this
river, as I thought I might cut Te Kooti&rsquo;s spoor
on the beach of the lake, which I determined to
examine next morning. I feared to do so that
evening, as they might have ambushed the drift,
and there was also the dread of the ambuscade he
most likely had left behind to watch our camp.</p>

<p>This party, after they had watched the column
move away, would most likely, provided they had
not seen us, be on the march to catch up Te Kooti.</p>

<p>We therefore hid on a fern ridge with the drift in
view of us, and fortunate it was for us we did so.</p>

<p>We had not been there long when we saw coming
from the north, along the beach, a party of
twelve natives; and I felt much relieved, for I
knew at once that they had not seen us, or they
would have been after us, and that I had been quite
right to make the detour I had done.</p>

<p>They marched quite carelessly, evidently thinking
no white man was nearer them than the
retreating column, and when they had crossed the
drift lit a big fire, cooked food and warmed themselves;
then, leaving the fire burning, started at
a rapid pace for the south.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>We watched them round a far cape of the lake,
then down we went to their fire and warmed ourselves
and cooked a bit of bacon. Thankful we
were for the warmth and food; but we dare not
stay long.</p>

<p>I wanted to get the benefit of the open beach, and
also to spot their camp fire that night; so, as soon as
our frozen limbs were thawed and our food swallowed,
we were off, hiding our spoor as well as we could.</p>

<p>That night we saw their camp, and envied them
as we lay hid in the fern shivering with cold; for
again we had a hard frost, and our clothes were far
from dry; but a scout must put up with cold, heat,
hunger, thirst, and be ready to face, smiling, anything
that falls to his lot.</p>

<p>The earlier in life he hardens himself to do
without rotten sweetstuff the better, and always
remember that cigarettes are the invention of the
evil one.</p>

<p>Well, day after day this sort of life went on.
If I were to try to describe our adventures day
by day they would fill a book; let it suffice that for
ten days we lurked through tangled and dripping
bush, waded up the bed of mountain torrents,
crossed snowclad ranges, and struggled through
matted fern, soaked with rain and sleet during the
day, and frozen stiff during the bitter nights. Our
miserable rations were gone. Sometimes we
found a rotten matti-tree, and from it extracted
the white grubs, which we ate thankfully. Once
we found some potatoes.</p>

<p>At last we discovered Te Kooti, and where he
was building his new pah.</p>

<p>For one night I prowled round it, and long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
before morning we were on our way back. For
the first two days the same care had to be taken
to hide our spoor; it would never do to be caught
or killed after all our troubles and sufferings.</p>

<p>On the third day I moved down to the lake.</p>

<p>We were starving: not just hungry, but absolutely
starving. As the evening was coming on, in a
small bay I saw the smoke of a fire; that meant
Maoris camping. They had food of some sort, and
we decided to have it.</p>

<p>The bay was an inlet, into which a small creek
emptied itself, between two low ridges of fern.
A short detour led us to the bed of the creek,
down which we descended as quietly as otters,
while the noise of the stream drowned any slight
noise we might make in wading down it. The
creek ran into a small clump of tree ferns, and we
crept on till we came to where the party was
encamped at the mouth of the creek.</p>

<p>There were four fine-looking big Maoris. Their
canoe was drawn up on the bank of the creek with
the paddles leaning against it. Had there been
more than four paddles it would have meant that
some of the party were absent; but now we knew
we had only the four in front to tackle. We dare
not use our fire-arms on account of the report. No,
the job must be done with tomahawk and knife.
We were within twenty feet of them.</p>

<p>A glance at my companions and we laid down
our carbines, slipped off our blankets and drew
our tomahawks and knives.</p>

<p>One more look. The four Maoris were sitting
by their fire, unconscious of our presence. A nod
to my mates and we sprang at them. Whiz, whiz<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
went my men&rsquo;s knives&mdash;they were both past
masters at the art of knife-throwing&mdash;and over
went two Maoris with the knives buried up to the
hafts in their bodies.</p>

<p>I rushed my man, but, surprised as he was, he
was a splendid, tough old warrior, and jumped at
me, his tomahawk swinging loosely in the air above
his head.</p>

<p>I had practised hard with the tomahawk for the
last two years, but I knew I was no match for the
old man. I therefore determined to rush in on
him, guard his first blow and use my left fist. (I
was very strong in those days, and a good boxer.)
Throwing up my tomahawk, I guarded a smashing
cut at the left of my neck, and although I felt the
keen edge of the blade cut my flesh on the left
shoulder, the impetus of my charge carried me in,
and lashing out with my left I struck him full on
the throat. Down he went, astonished by this
novel mode of attack, and in another moment the
head of my tomahawk was buried up to the eye
in his brains.</p>

<p>When I looked round the fight was over, the
only unwounded Maori falling an easy prey to
the combined attack of my two desperadoes.</p>

<p>Pierre, a splendid cook, was already looking into
the pot that was on the fire, and, declaring the
contents to be good pork, not long pig, we were
soon enjoying it. To get rid of the bodies did
not take long. The marks of the struggle were
obliterated, and we were off. Two days more and
we reached Opepe; and, true to his word, my colonel
met us with a strong patrol. We were thin, footsore,
our legs torn, our kit in rags; but what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
mattered that? We had done our duty and had
got back with valuable information, and as we
swallowed some hot tea we did not care for the
past&mdash;it was past. My wound was nothing&mdash;Pierre
had stitched it up&mdash;and as I once more donned
my breeches and boots, a clean shirt, and threw
my leg over my dear old horse, I was as happy as
the day was wet.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>THE COLONEL&rsquo;S FIERY TOT</small></h2>

<p>(<i>Told by the old Kai Tongata</i>)</p>


<p>During the east coast war the division in which
I was serving landed on the beach to seize a
&ldquo;pah,&rdquo; or native stronghold, two days&rsquo; march
inland. As usual we carried four days&rsquo; rations,
including rum. We were led by a fine old colonel,
a distinguished Crimean officer, who was much
liked by the men. He was one of the old &ldquo;two-bottle
men&rdquo;&mdash;or, rather, he was contented with
two bottles when he could not get three.</p>

<p>At that time I had not acquired a liking for
ration rum&mdash;raw, fiery stuff&mdash;but by the end of the
second day&rsquo;s march the colonel had consumed his
own allowance and mine too. At daylight on the
third day, when we had fallen in beside a creek,
and were preparing to attack, he said to me:
&ldquo;Give me a tot&rdquo; (calling me by a nickname
I acquired early and retained throughout my active
career).</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any rum, sir; you finished mine last
night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He bubbled like a furious turkey-cock, and swore
I&rsquo;d drunk more than my share. As I had not
tasted a drop, I thought this unfair, but wisely said
nothing. It is bad policy to argue with a liverish
colonel, when he is two days&rsquo; march from the
nearest drink.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he said: &ldquo;I must have a tot. I wonder
whether the men have any left.&rdquo; I was just
promising to inquire when he exclaimed excitedly:
&ldquo;Look there!&rdquo; And lo and behold, a man stepped
out of the ranks, then standing easy, and took from
his haversack a bottle containing something that
looked like rum. He poured some into a pannikin,
poured in some water and drank it off. &ldquo;By
heavens,&rdquo; said the old colonel, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve struck oil.&rdquo;
Just then I called the men to &ldquo;attention,&rdquo; and as
we went down the ranks inspecting the colonel kept
saying: &ldquo;Deuced bad pain in my stomach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As we got opposite the man with the bottle&mdash;he
was, by the way, the most temperate man in the
corps&mdash;the colonel&rsquo;s groans became heart-rending.
The man thereupon brought out the bottle from his
haversack, and said to him: &ldquo;Do you think this
would do you any good, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The colonel&rsquo;s face was wreathed in smiles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aha, my man, just what I wanted,&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;Give me your pannikin.&rdquo; And he proceeded to
pour out for himself a strong &ldquo;tot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be careful, sir,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s very strong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the colonel, &ldquo;when you&rsquo;re as old a
soldier as I am you&rsquo;ll be able to take your &lsquo;tot&rsquo;
neat.&rdquo; And with that he tossed it down.</p>

<p>The change that came over his face was
marvellous! The smiles were replaced by a look
of agonised surprise. He coughed and spluttered,
and ejaculated: &ldquo;Shoot the blackguard;
he&rsquo;s poisoned me!&rdquo; Then he rushed to the creek
and drank more water in ten minutes than he had
drunk in the ten previous years. &ldquo;What have you
given the colonel?&rdquo; I asked the man.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Perry &amp; Davis&rsquo;s Pain-killer,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Will
you try some, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I put my tongue to the mouth of the bottle
and then said, &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m blowed if I do.&rdquo; For
the stuff was like liquid fire, and was hot
enough to burn the entrails out of a brass monkey,
and if applied externally would have blistered the
halo from a plaster saint. It also claimed to cure
everything. In that it lied, for it did not cure the
colonel&rsquo;s propensity for ration rum, although I
must admit it made him very careful for some time
to sample his tot before he swallowed it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>LOST IN THE NEW ZEALAND BUSH</small></h2>


<p>In spinning this yarn I wish to warn all new chums
that, no matter how clever you may fancy yourself
to be, you must, when you enter a bush, keep all
your senses on deck, or you will run the chance
of finding yourself bushed just as easily as the
greenest tenderfoot ever exported. True, an old
hand will, as a rule, pull through, while the greenhorn
will go under; but yet the number of old
bushmen who have been lost and who have died
is very great, and no one, no matter how experienced
he is, or what his training has been, has a
right to enter the bush without taking every
precaution. This was driven into me very early
in my frontier education, and I have saved myself
frequently if not from death, yet from many hardships,
by always ascertaining I had sufficient of
the indispensable articles about me, without which
no man should enter the forest or wilderness.</p>

<p>Perhaps, right here, I may enumerate them. In
a dry country a man should always carry a water-bag
or bottle, and see that it is in good order and
full; he should never stir without plenty of matches,
carried in a damp-proof box or well-corked bottle,
a flint and steel, a burning-glass, or some means
of making a fire. A tomahawk and sheath knife
are indispensable; and of course, in Africa and
countries where there are lions, etc., see that you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
have plenty of ammunition with you&mdash;remember
you may want to signal with your rifle&mdash;and if
possible shove a couple of ship biscuits into your
haversack: you may want them, and they do not
weigh much.</p>

<p>Now for the yarn. In 1874 I was located at
a place called Wai-Tangi (Murmuring Water), a
native kainga, on Lake Tarawera, and one day
determined to go pigeon and kaka (New Zealand
parrot) shooting in the densely bushed ranges on
the east side of the lake. The lake is a very beautiful
one, of large size, surrounded by mountains,
among which is the volcano Mount Tarawera, and
at the south-west corner is the creek that leads up
to Rotomahana and the wonderful terraces.</p>

<p>At the date I write about Mount Tarawera was
quiet, and everyone thought it had retired from
the volcano business; but some years afterwards,
1886, it took a fit, broke out, blew the terraces
galley west, destroyed a great deal of property and
killed a good few people, among others my quondam
hosts at Wai-Tangi. Now the New Zealand kaka
and pigeon are, in the fall of the year, very toothsome
birds indeed; they get very fat on the berries
of the gigantic trees, and the Maoris have a very
good way of preserving them. I mention these
last facts, as, previous to my departure from the
kainga, I had told my host, the chief of the place,
that I was going to try to kill a great many birds,
had requested him to order a woman to make a
couple of large bark buckets to preserve them in,
and had also intimated I might camp out or stay
for a night or two at one or other village on the
lake.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>This was unfortunate, as, subsequently, the
Maoris took no notice of my prolonged absence
and did not come to look for me, as they concluded
I was staying somewhere else; and it was only on
the day of my return the old chief, having become
anxious, started a party of young warriors to
paddle round the lake to find out if I were all right.</p>

<p>Well, I started off in a canoe, taking with me
my gun, fifty No. 4 shot cartridges, some tea and
sugar, a couple of blankets and half-a-dozen ship
biscuits. I should also have taken a young warrior,
but as all the natives were engaged on their plantations,
I went alone. It was a lovely day, the lake
as calm as a millpond and the splendid scenery
most entrancing. I paddled slowly out of the
little bay at the head of which the kainga stood,
and after a few minutes&rsquo; contemplation of the
glorious bushed mountains, whose beauties were
reflected as in a mirror on the glass-like water,
I struck out across the north-east corner of the
lake and made for the east shore, where I meant
to beach my canoe in some small bay at the mouth
of one of the numerous creeks that ran into the
lake, then ascend the bed of the creek, get on the
top of the high ranges, where there is comparatively
little undergrowth, and shoot my game. After a
few miles steady paddling I reached the shore,
where there was rather a deep inlet, grounded
my canoe on the beach at the head of it, where
a fair-sized creek entered the lake, and landed.</p>

<p>Now I mentioned before that I had made the best
use of my frontier education; so at once I dragged
my canoe out of the water as far as I could and
made fast the painter to a stout tree, then over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>hauled
my belongings. I was dressed in proper
bush outfit: a serge jumper, flannel shirt, smasher
hat, good strong shooting boots and a shawl round
my waist instead of trousers. In my belt I wore
a tomahawk and sheath knife, and slung on to the
back of it was a strong tin pannikin. I also carried
on my belt a leather pouch containing a metal
damp-proof box full of matches, a burning-glass,
a plug of tobacco and my pipe. My cartridges
I wore in a bandoleer over one shoulder, and over
the other I wore one of the old-fashioned game
bags. I was very strong in those days and did
not mind a little extra weight; so after I had
lunched on a biscuit and a lump of cold pork I put
the remaining biscuits, a tin containing tea and sugar
mixed, and a small one holding salt and pepper
mixed, into my bag, hid my blankets and paddle,
and after a glance to see that my canoe was all
right, I entered the creek and started up the range.</p>

<p>For some distance the brushwood and undergrowth
were too thick for me to be able to see a
bird on the tree-tops, but as I got higher up the
range the bush thinned out, so that I could
occasionally get a shot, and I found when I came
to the summit I had bagged three brace of birds.
These I hung up on a rata-tree and I out tomahawk
and blazed it well, so as to let me know, on
my return, it was the point at which I was to
descend to the lake. The country I found myself
in was very broken, and what had appeared from
the lake to be a straight range of mountains
running from north to south I found to be a regular
jumble of broken ridges, cliffs and spurs that
seemed to be mixed into several ranges that took<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
no definite direction at all. This sort of country
is very dangerous to explore and, knowing the fact,
I ought to have taken precautions and exercised
the greatest care. I did neither; for I wandered
on after the birds and presently began thinking
about some important letters I had lately received
from home, and other matters, without even noting
any of the salient landmarks, or the turnings and
twistings of the broken ridges and spurs I was
walking among. Nor did I turn round and spot
landmarks to guide my return journey. This was
an act of folly unpardonable for a scout who knew
his work and who was quite aware of the danger
he was running. Yet the very best and most
experienced bushmen sometimes commit an act
of folly, and, not being infallible, I had in my turn
committed a very grave one. For when the approaching
dusk warned me it was time to regain
my canoe I turned round, and in a moment knew
I was lost. You may ask how it was I knew at
once I was lost. I will tell you.</p>

<p>Every scout worth his salt should carry in his
head a map of the road he has been traversing that
day, and when he is about to return on the back
track he should at once be able to see that road
with his mind&rsquo;s eye, its salient points, its landmarks,
its difficulties, and everything worthy of
note along it. Well, when I turned I naturally
cast my mind&rsquo;s eye on to my map and found a
blank. I had noted nothing from the time I had
hung up the birds and blazed the first tree; and I
cussed myself for my folly. It was now I felt bush
fear; for a desperate longing came over me <i>to run</i>
and try to find my way; but this I combated with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
all my will-power, and after a minute&rsquo;s struggle
forced myself to sit down under a tree and think
if I could not remember anything that might recall
the road to mind; but in vain. The only thing to
guide me was that I had shot a pigeon which had
fallen into a fork of a tree and stuck there; that
incident could be of but little use to me, yet I
treasured it. Again the desire, stronger than ever,
came over me to run and look for the tree I had
blazed; and again I had to fight it away.</p>

<p>Was I, fool as I had been, to lose my head and
run mad through the bush like an untrained new
chum? Not by a jugful. I would camp where I
was, and next morning, with a clear head, would
try to unravel the puzzle. Work was the thing
for me, and I turned to. It did not take me long
to collect plenty of firewood and make down a good
fern bed. Water I could hear close by, and when
I had filled my pannikin I lit my fire, for night
falls quickly in the New Zealand bush, and overhauled
my stores. I had my gun and over thirty
cartridges left, and, besides what food I had brought
with me, I had ten fat birds; so there was no fear
of starvation for a long time. I had also no fear
of thirst, as there is always plenty of water to be
found in a New Zealand bush; so I was well off,
though I could not disguise the danger. Anyhow
I would have supper and think matters out, over
a pipe, afterwards. In next door to no time I
had two birds plucked, cleaned, and spitted on a
splinter of wood, with a biscuit on a clean piece
of bark under them. My pannikin, full of water,
on some embers, soon boiled; to this was added
some tea and sugar mixed, and I had a feast for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
the gods. True, I only had my sheath knife and
fingers to eat with, but what of that? I was an
old campaigner and could dispense with luxuries.
Then, my meal over, I lit my pipe and thought out
my position. I was in a hole, that I knew, and I
should require all my bushcraft to get out of it.
It was not as if I was in a forest on a plain, but I
was in a regular jumble of broken ridges, valleys
and spurs, all of them heavily bushed. The only
thing I had to look for was a blazed tree with some
birds hanging on to it, and I did not know if I were
north, south or east of it; nor could I judge my
distance from it; for although I knew I had walked
about four hours and a half, and that I had turned
south when I left the tree, yet, for all I knew, I
might have worked round in a circle and at the
present moment be due north of it, or have turned
farther to the east.</p>

<p>My pipe finished, I determined to sleep if I
could, so as to be fresh in the morning, and also
to try to get rid of the feeling of solitude that
now attacked and surprised me. I had frequently
had to pass the night alone, aye, many a time,
without fire or food, not daring to light the one
and having none of the other; yet I had never felt
so lonely or deserted before; for although I well
knew there was nothing in the New Zealand bush
that could hurt me, still I kept on looking over
my shoulder, or glancing to right and left into the
darkness, and I could now realise the feelings that
men who had been lost and found had tried
to describe to me. They had been tenderfoots.
Faugh! I was an old hand; I had never funked
the Hau Haus when they had been on the warpath<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
after me. Why now should I let these childish
qualms assail me and funk shadows? Yet they
were there; and I confess them to you so that you
may know how absolutely necessary it is for you,
in case you should ever be in the same fix, no
matter how experienced you are, to keep a tight
hold over yourself, and not let your nerves get
away with you. Rolling myself up in my shawl,
I lay down on my fern bed (a very comfortable bed
it is too, if you know how to make it properly) and,
thinking over my plans for the morrow, went to
sleep.</p>

<p>I awoke at daybreak refreshed and fit. A cold
bath in the creek. A good breakfast. Then
selecting a huge tree, I climbed it by shinning up
one of the big pendent vines, and had a good look
round. I had hoped to be able to see the lake, but
could see nothing of it; nor could I recognise any
of the loftier mountains; but I knew the lake must
be to the westward of me, and as there seemed to
be a higher range in that direction I determined
to make for it, though I could see no spur running
in a direct line towards it. I therefore descended
and, carefully blazing the big tree under which I
had camped, started, taking care to blaze all the
trees on my line. My reason for doing so (and
bear it in mind) was, I had reached the spot where
I found myself lost, without going down into any
of the deep valleys that surrounded me. Had I
done so, I must have remembered the fact, as all
the valleys were full of dense undergrowth, and I
should have had to cut a road through it.</p>

<p>I had not used my tomahawk on the previous
day, except to blaze the first tree, therefore there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
must be some way of getting back without using it&mdash;if
I could only find that way. I was making for
the west. Suppose after a time I should be certain
I was going wrong, I could return with ease along
the blazed track back to my camp, and start a new
line, which I should also blaze, using a new
tomahawk cut on the trees, and if that line failed,
return and try again, always using the tree under
which I had camped as a starting-point. I might
fail half-a-dozen times or more, yet, with patience,
I had a good chance to come out right in the end.
Again, although I did not reckon on it in my case,
as I had no hopes of a search party coming to look
for me, if you should ever be bushed, and you
think it possible for a search to be sent to find
you, it is a very good thing to carry out the above
plan, and always return to your first camp, as most
probably it will be the nearest spot to help; and if
you pass your time in blazing lines (being careful
to keep your lines distinct) the party looking for
you will most likely strike one of your tracks and
easily follow it to your assistance.</p>

<p>Knowing all this, I started, taking a course due
west. I had no compass, but as a trained bushman
I wanted none, and with all my senses on deck I
began blazing trees on my line, taking care to spot
every noticeable thing <i>en route</i>, and frequently
looking back to see my track ran straight. Sometimes
I fancied I was going right and I felt the
impulse to run; but this feeling I at once suppressed,
and determined I would play the game to the end.
Past midday I knew I was wrong, as I came to a
steep cliff descending perpendicularly into a deep
valley, so I knew I could not have crossed it before.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
I was disappointed but by no means disheartened;
so after a good look around I turned in my tracks
and easily regained my camp, where I cooked more
birds, had a good supper and slept without any
bogeys coming to trouble me.</p>

<p>On the morning of the third day I started again
and blazed a new line, in a north-west direction;
but again I met with disappointment and returned
to my base.</p>

<p>You may ask how it was that, as a trained scout,
I did not try to follow my own spoor back to my
starting-point. I will tell you at once. I was far
too old at the game to waste my time by doing so.
Of course I was always on the look-out for any
trace I had left; but there is very little soft ground
on the top of New Zealand ranges, and although
I was in a daydream on the first afternoon, yet I
knew that, instinctively, I should have avoided any
soft or damp ground, also the gloom in a bush is
not a good light to track by. An Australian black
fellow might have been able to follow my spoor,
but no one else, so I did not try to.</p>

<p>On the morning of the fourth day I started on
what I thought to be a hopeless line nearly due
north, as I expected to be shut off quickly by a deep
valley I had noticed on the previous day; still it was
the right game to play and I played it. Strange as
it may appear, I was not shut off as I had expected,
but continued on till I came to a couple of large
trees growing so close together that they seemed
to spring from the same root. These attracted my
attention, and although they were out of my line I
went to them. I seemed to remember them in a
dim sort of way, and I examined the ground care<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>fully,
going on my hands and knees to do so. I
also took a good steady look at the country I had just
passed over, to see if any glimmer of remembrance
would dawn on me; and it did, but so faint that I
feared the wish was father to the thought. But
yet, those trees! A certainty came to me that I had
seen them before, and I crawled round to the other
side of them, scanning every foot of ground, and
found what might be the spoor of one of my boots.</p>

<p>At once I began to feel elated, and again the mad
impulse to run came on; but I crushed it back,
marked the spoor and forced myself to sit down
and smoke a pipe. When I was quite cool I
again examined the spoor, determined to restart
my line from there and use the trees as a base.</p>

<p>I started a new line and had not gone very far
when under a tree I saw a lot of pigeon feathers. I
at once went on my hands and knees and after a
few minutes&rsquo; search found undoubted spoor; so I
knew I was on the right track; and again the desire
to run came on, but I squashed it and, blazing the
tree well, had a good look round, but could get no
certainty as to my route, so went on with my line
and during the afternoon found myself blocked, and
had to turn back. That evening I shot three birds,
and camped at the tree where I had found the
feathers.</p>

<p>Next morning I was off, after a good breakfast,
taking a new line west of north, thinking it
would only be a short one; but yet I got on farther
than I expected, and with my eyes glancing
everywhere, all of a sudden I spotted something
in the stunted fern, and going up to it found a dead
pigeon. Looking up, I noticed a fork in the tree<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
close by and recognised it, as the one in which my
bird had lodged. I at once tore the feathers off the
bird. Yes, there could be no doubt, it had been
killed by No. 4 shot; and now I was certain I
was more than half-way out of the fix. Again the
crazy desire to run, this time crushed with more
difficulty and requiring a pipe. Then more blazing,
until I began to think I must again be wrong and
found myself unduly hastening my steps, and had
to use the curb of my will to rein in. I had
reached a place where I was thinking seriously of
turning back, as I was convinced I had gone wrong,
and had in fact halted when I noticed something
waving in the wind about 150 yards away to the
south. I could only now and then catch a glimmer
of it through the trees, but I went towards it. I
lost sight of it in the bush, then saw it again, and
in a few minutes was standing in front of a blazed
rata-tree with six pigeons hanging on it.</p>

<p>Here was my starting-point; but I was so convinced
I had gone wrong that for a minute or two
I could not believe my eyesight, and fancied I had
gone mad, in fact was so surprised that I had to
argue with myself that someone had not moved the
tree and the birds. This folly did not last long, and
I was quickly in the bed of the creek, descending
to the lake. I had just reached the foot of the hill
when my foot slipped on a boulder and I came an
awful cropper. In a moment I realised I had
sprained my left ankle badly and had hurt my left
side and shoulder. Groaning and cursing with
pain, I managed to crawl the remaining way to
my canoe, untied the painter, crawled to the place
where I had hidden my paddle and blankets, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
with much agony got my right shoulder to the bow
of the canoe and launched her. It made me shudder
with pain to use the paddle&mdash;for a Maori paddle
requires both hands&mdash;but it had to be done, and I
slowly worked out of the inlet, when to my horror
I found I had a strong head wind to contend
against.</p>

<p>I could never do it, and was painfully turning
my canoe to get back to the beach when I heard
a deep-chested Maori shout come pealing over
the water, and looking in the direction from
whence it came, I saw a large canoe with a dozen
sturdy paddlers bearing down on me. In a few
minutes I was in it, lying down on a heap of fern;
and I must have fainted, but soon came to, to find
the canoe tearing through the water, while fourteen
stalwart warriors howled a canoe song to bring
me back to life and give time to the paddles. We
soon reached Wai-Tangi, and I was carried up
to my hut, all the Maoris holding a big tangi
(weeping match) over my accident and blaming
themselves for the misadventure that had
happened to their guest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Te Parione&rdquo; (my Maori name) quoth the chief,
&ldquo;your mana (luck) is very great. If you had fallen
three days ago where would you have been now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not a nice conundrum to puzzle over, so
I went to sleep instead.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>A TROOPER&rsquo;S REGARD FOR HIS TRUST AND HORSE</small></h2>


<p>Years ago on the Taupo line (the road running
from Napier to Lake Taupo) everything used by
the men garrisoning the forts on the line had to
be carried on pack-horses from the town of Napier
up to the headquarters (Opepe), and this necessitated
hard work and required hard language on
the part of the troopers escorting the pack train,
which consisted of some sixty horses and mules.</p>

<p>Of course the men were held responsible for the
goods or valuables entrusted to them, and they
regarded this trust as a point of honour that must
be guarded even with life.</p>

<p>Now why a pack-mule or a transport ox won&rsquo;t
go without the strongest language I don&rsquo;t know;
but they won&rsquo;t; and in making this assertion I am
only stating a well-known and proven fact. No
matter how good a man may be with a stock-whip,
or a waggon-whip, he will not get a journey or trek
out of his beasts unless he beguiles them with the
most powerful and sultry talk.</p>

<p>I have never known a man to love a pack-mule,
nor to caress one, and although you will find a
trooper fond of and kind to most animals, yet
somehow he draws the line at a mule. For his horse
he will do anything&mdash;beg for it, lie for it, steal for
it, halve his last bit of bread with it, and willingly
risk his life for it&mdash;but not for a pack-mule. No, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
pack-mule has few friends, and though men do their
duty by them they don&rsquo;t give up their only blanket
to them on a bitter cold night; and I have known
many a trooper do that for his horse. However,
I am getting off the right spoor, so must try back
for the yarn.</p>

<p>On the Taupo line, at the time I mention, about
1872&mdash;-the exact date I forget, and is of no consequence&mdash;-the
forces were rationed by a firm of
contractors who had the right to run a canteen at
each of the forts.</p>

<p>The rations were good, but the liquor was bad;
and when an old campaigner calls liquor bad, it
must be very bad indeed. There were plenty of
rows about it, and changes were promised, but
somehow it never improved. This being so, it was
the usual thing, when the pack train went down-country,
for two or three of us who could not face
the filth supplied by the contractors to send down
a private horse and get up a couple of cases of
spirits fit to drink.</p>

<p>I was quartered at the time at an outlying
station that the pack train did not pass, and one
day received a note telling me to come to Fort
Tarawera and get my share of two cases of brandy
that had reached there.</p>

<p>This I did, and rode over next day, accompanied
by a very smart trooper named Steve&mdash;at least
that name will do for him, as he left the Lost Legion
and has been for years a parson in the Church
of England. Good luck to him!</p>

<p>Now the road, or rather the bridle-track, was a
sinful one, partly through bush and partly along
the bank of the Waipunga River. At one place the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
path had been scraped out of a very steep hill of
loose shale sloping down to the river, which ran
about eighty to one hundred feet below it, and it
was so narrow that, once on it, you could not turn
your horse, nor even dismount.</p>

<p>The length of this very bad bit was not more
than two hundred yards, but there was a nasty
turn half-way, so that it was necessary for you
before you entered on it to give a loud shout in
case anyone was approaching from the other end;
and altogether it was not the sort of road to entice
a nervous old gentleman to ride a restive horse
along for a constitutional.</p>

<p>We reached Fort Tarawera in safety, and I put
in a very pleasant afternoon, hearing the news and
yarning with my pals there. Towards evening we
left with my share of the plunder, which consisted
of four bottles of brandy, to ride back the fourteen
miles to my station. These bottles we carried
in our wallets in front of our saddles, and after a
parting drink and cheery good-night we rode gaily
away.</p>

<p>It was quite dark when we reached the worst
part of the road; but in those days neither of us
cared for anything, so that after a loud coo-ee we
filed on to the bad track, myself leading.</p>

<p>Previous to our quitting the firm ground, I had
said to my companion, in a joking manner: &ldquo;Take
care you don&rsquo;t tumble over, Steve; remember you
are carrying precious brandy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He answered: &ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll look after it.&rdquo;
And we started the crossing.</p>

<p>Just as we got to the very worst part of the road
I heard a scuffle, an oath, a rattling crash, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
knew in a moment that Steve with his horse had
gone over the cliff, and rolled down the slope into
the river.</p>

<p>I was close to the end of the bad part; so, pressing
my horse on to the firm ground, dismounted,
and led him back to the place of the catastrophe.
Peering over, I could see nothing, so shouted:
&ldquo;Steve, are you much hurt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The answer came back and there was an exultant
ring in the voice: &ldquo;The brandy is quite safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;D&mdash;- the brandy! Are you much hurt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A mournful reply came back: &ldquo;Poor Darkie [his
horse] is dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve only broken my leg,&rdquo; was the answer,
given in a tone of the most utter indifference; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is your head well above water, and can you
hang on till I get help from the fort?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes; I&rsquo;m all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So I told him to open one of the bottles and
have a nip when he felt he required it, then led
my horse to the firm ground, mounted and rode
back to Tarawera at a gallop.</p>

<p>On my return with a party of troopers, ropes and
torches, it took us a long time to extricate the poor
fellow from his dangerous position, and he must
have suffered great agony in being hauled up the
steep bank of shifting shale; but at last we managed
it, and got him back to the fort, where he soon
become convalescent, his only regret, which was
very deep&mdash;viz. the loss of his horse&mdash;being
tempered by the fact that he had saved the brandy
which had been entrusted to him. As for his own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
severe and painful injury, he cared nothing: it was
certainly a nuisance; but it came in the day&rsquo;s march,
and, as there was no fighting going on at the time,
was not to be grumbled at.</p>

<p>Well, as I said before, good luck to him. If he
is half as good in the pulpit as he was in the
pigskin, the Church gained what the Legion lost,
by his exchange of regiments.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small>A GRUESOME FLUTE</small></h2>

<p>(<i>Told by the old Kai Tongata</i>)</p>


<p>There was nothing of a picnic about the wars in
New Zealand.</p>

<p>The cold-blooded massacres at Poverty Bay,
Mohaka, and scores of other places, as well as the
vile tortures practised on any of our men who
were unfortunate enough to fall alive into their
hands, made us treat the Hau Haus with very
scant mercy; and this savagery was not diminished
by the brutal hardships, hunger, cold and toil we
underwent while in pursuit of Te Kooti and his
bands of bloodthirsty and fanatical followers.</p>

<p>Among these was a half-caste, the son of a very
prominent white official. As a boy he had been
sent to school by his father, and had been highly
educated. He had then been entered for the law,
but, committing a forgery, had fled to the bush and
joined his mother&rsquo;s tribe, then in rebellion.</p>

<p>To show and prove his Maori blood, on joining
them he had murdered, with his own hand, in cold
blood, a number of helpless white women and
children who had been taken prisoners; and this
horrible crime, together with his ferocious courage
in action, and further murders, perpetrated whenever
he had the chance, caused him to be held in
high repute by the Hau Haus and in bitter detestation
by us.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>To such an evil notoriety had this fiend attained
that his father, then high in the Government, sent
the unnecessary and quite superfluous order, that
if his son were captured he was to receive no
mercy. This order I carried myself to the officer
commanding one of the flying columns that was
then operating against rebels who by that time
were getting considerably knocked about.</p>

<p>It was most dangerous work, despatch-riding in
New Zealand. You had to travel through a rough
and hostile country to find a moving column, or
perchance a place the position of which was not
known, and even the direction to it most uncertain.
The Hau Haus, always on the look-out to catch the
unfortunates employed on this job, would lay ambuscades
in the long fern, alongside the footpaths, in
such places as it was impossible to avoid passing,
or at a ford you were obliged to cross.</p>

<p>Their dart was to kill your horse and take you
alive, if possible, and then God help you if you
were unable to blow your brains out&mdash;your death
would be a very, very hard one.</p>

<p>We lost numbers of men this way; and although
no officer or man was ever known to shrink the
duty, yet we hated it. On the arrival of this most
unnecessary order to the column with which I was
serving, being first for duty, it was my fate to have
to carry it on to another column and then, provided
I lived, to rejoin my colonel at the earliest possible
moment.</p>

<p>Now I was aware of the contents of the despatch,
and it did not make me more pleased with the job,
as I knew I was running the most desperate risks
to carry an order absolutely superfluous.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>Long before the despatch had even been penned,
had either of the three white columns been lucky
enough to catch the bounder whose name was
mentioned in it, he would have been shot on the
spot; while if Rapata and his friendly natives had
rounded him up his end would have been quite as
certain, though probably more complicated; and
any orders on the subject were quite superfluous.</p>

<p>Well, I was warned to go, and went. I started
at daylight, and after a long day&rsquo;s ride, during
which I had a few squeaks for my bacon, I fortunately,
just as evening was coming on, fell in with
the column I was in search of, and delivered my
despatches to the O.C.</p>

<p>This column was composed of friendly natives,
of course on foot, so I dismounted and joined the
O.C., who was making for a camping-ground on
which to pass the night.</p>

<p>We had nearly reached the desired spot when
a body of the enemy who, unaware of our presence,
were making for the same place opened fire on us.</p>

<p>The O.C. and myself were some short distance
ahead of the majority of his men, who, after the
usual way of native contingents, straggled a good
deal when marching into camp.</p>

<p>We, however, at once charged, and the enemy
gave ground until we came to a long natural
opening in the manuka scrub, through which we
were moving, and which was about twenty yards
across. Here we halted and took cover, as we
heard the Hau Hau leader shout to his men to
turn and come back quickly, as there were only
two white men by themselves and they, the Hau
Haus, could kill them before the others came up.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
We stood our ground, as we knew our men were
close up, and we both carried carbines.</p>

<p>All at once I saw a man on the other side of the
opening aiming at my companion, and I at once
fired and knocked him over; at the same moment
my companion fired and hit a man I could not see,
but who was aiming at me. Our men just then
rushed up, and we continued the charge; but the
enemy had bolted, and as night was falling fast
we did not pursue them, but went up to the two
men we had put out of mess. My man was quite
dead, and was quickly recognised as a man of no
great consequence, though of some reputation as a
fighting man. The other one, however, was only
wounded, but refused to tell us who he was, and to
our questions replied by using the greatest insult
in the Maori language&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> called us boiled heads.
Having a suspicion as to his identity, the O.C. tore
the breast of his shirt open, and there across
his breast was tattooed the much-cursed name.
Well, if he had lived like a beast, he met the death
of a beast without flinching.</p>

<p>Two years later, after the wars were over, I was
again crossing that part of the country and rode
a little out of my way to the scene of the fight,
to see if there were any traces of the men we had
killed. Sure enough the skeleton of the half-caste
was at the very spot on which he had fallen. Dismounting,
I picked up a leg-bone, slipped it under my
wallet straps and rode away. Later, I had it made
up into a Maori flute by an old native&mdash;they used
to make all sorts of useful and ornamental instruments
out of human bones&mdash;and hung it on the wall
of my quarters among other trophies and curios.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>Some time after I was visited by the very official
who had been father to this half-caste. He
examined my collection of curiosities with some
interest, and catching sight of the flute, said: &ldquo;Oh,
I used to tootle a bit on a Maori flute in my young
days.&rdquo; Then taking it down he tootled a &ldquo;wyetta&rdquo;
(a Maori song). Little did he think he was playing a
tune on the leg-bone of his own son; and I was not
such a bally fool as to tell him.</p>

<p>Let sleeping dogs lie is an old and true aphorism,
and I did not wish to stir up bitter family recollections
by reminding him of a dead one; besides, he was a
very big pot indeed, and the head of my department,
so that a discreet silence as to who had been the
original owner of that flute was sound policy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />

<small>THE DOCTOR AND THE SENTRY</small></h2>


<p>Years ago in New Zealand there was a chain of
forts stretching from the sea to the centre of the
island. These forts were intended to keep open
the road that had been constructed at great trouble
and expense, on which a coach ran every week,
conveying the mails and passengers to and from
the wonderlands of Taupo and Rotomahana.</p>

<p>The headquarters of the district was at a place
called Opepe, and consisted of a strong stockaded
fort on the top of a pumice-stone hill, or, rather, I
should say on a flat piece of ground surrounded by
steep-sided gullies, which made it into a hill, and
contained sufficient area for the fort and a parade
ground.</p>

<p>Through the gully in front ran the road, and
on the other side of the road were the troopers&rsquo;
stables and a hotel for coach passengers, which also
held the troopers&rsquo; canteen. The fort was approached
by a zigzag path cut out of the hill, which
was here perpendicular, and on the top of the path
was posted a sentry.</p>

<p>Now among the officers stationed at headquarters
was a doctor who had medical charge of the district.
As far as his profession went, he had scarcely anything
to do. The men were all picked men, most
of them young; and in that splendid climate, with
plenty of good, healthy work to do, sickness was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
almost unknown. This was very fortunately the
case, as the doctor, having, perhaps, too much spare
time on his hands, and caring nothing for sport,
devoted that time to the worship of Bacchus and, at
the time I write about, had become scarcely fit to
attend to a crocodile, much less a human being.</p>

<p>Had he not given the regimental sergeant-major
a dose for a cold that made that ancient
warrior tie himself into complicated knots, then
dance and squirm for a week, and even curse him
for a year afterwards with a fervency that made
the atmosphere tingle and the blue sky grow
cloudy? Yes, it was fortunate the men were a
healthy lot, and the doctor&rsquo;s medicine was not in
demand. The medico&rsquo;s appearance was also
decidedly against him. He wore his hair and
whiskers, which were white, very long. His face
was very red, and his nose, bulbous in shape, was
purple in colour. He was, moreover, very slovenly
in dress and dirty in his habits. It was strange
he, being an Irishman by birth, should be morose
and ill-tempered when sober (I beg his pardon. I
don&rsquo;t think I ever saw him really sober), and far
from amusing when drunk. So, taking him in the
large, he was neither popular nor respected by his
brother-officers nor by the men. He had never
been on active service, was very nervous of being
sent on it, and had a holy dread of fire-arms of
all sorts.</p>

<p>Well, this beauty made it his habit to go down
to the hotel every night and booze there by himself.
The men&rsquo;s canteen was closed at 9.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>,
and lights-out was blown at ten. The doctor
would leave the hotel at 10.30 and proceed up the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
hill to his quarters; and as by this time he was
quite full up, he would climb the steep zigzag path
on his hands and knees, and refuse to answer
the challenge of the sentry. This caused trouble;
he was reported over and over again and the
O.C. reprimanded him once or twice, till at last,
determining to give him a fright, he ordered
the sentry to be served out with some blank
ammunition, and that if the doctor again refused
to answer the challenge, he was to let rip at him
with a blank charge.</p>

<p>The following night the doctor began his crab-like
ascent. &ldquo;Halt, who goes there?&rdquo; rang out the
challenge. No answer. Twice again the challenge
was repeated. Still no answer. Bang went the
carbine. A loud yell from the medico, and he
rolled over and over to the foot of the hill.
Promptly the guard turned out. Down the hill
they ran and found the doctor much shaken by
his roll, and sobered by his fright.</p>

<p>They brought him up, and next morning at
office he complained to the O.C., and charged
the sentry with trying to murder him, swore
that he had heard the bullet whiz just past his
ear, and that it was dangerous to trust a sentry
with such a thing as a carbine.</p>

<p>The O.C. listened to him and told him he could
not punish the sentry for firing at him, as he was
performing his duty by doing so, but he would
severely reprimand him for making such a bad
shot, and the next sentry who missed him would
be severely punished.</p>

<p>This put the fear of the Lord into the doctor;
but the force of habit was too strong for him, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
the following night he was down at his usual haunt,
filled up, and started at 10.30, his usual time, to
return in his usual manner; but he took unusual
precautions. No sooner had he crept across the
road than he started howling at the top of his
voice: &ldquo;Friend, friend, friend&rdquo;; and so on up the
hill, past the laughing sentry and guard, across the
parade ground and crawled into his quarters, still
yelping his protecting cry.</p>

<p>This went on for a few nights, until one day he
had to visit an out-station. He stayed there that
day, got full up and started to return home that
night. He must have fallen off his old pony and
slept in the fern, for he did not turn up till 6 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>
next morning. Then, having handed over his nag
to the stable orderly, he immediately made for the
hotel, and began to freshen his nip with more
liquor. That day there was a commanding officer&rsquo;s
parade, and at 10 o&rsquo;clock all the officers and men
fell in. By 10.30 the inspection was over and the
men standing at ease, previous to the drill commencing,
when the howl of &ldquo;Friend, friend!&rdquo; was
heard coming nearer and nearer. It seems that
the doctor, true to the clock, had filled up, and at
his usual time, but, oblivious to the fact that it was
10.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, and not 10.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, was making the best
of his way to his lair and, by way of protection
against the possible murderous attack of the sentry,
was singing his usual ditty of &ldquo;Friend, friend!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Presently he appeared over the crest of the hill
on his hands and knees, crawling across the parade
ground towards the quarters, still uttering his doleful
howl, when, glancing up, he saw the long line
of men looking at him. He staggered to his feet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
and gazed at them for a full minute, with horror
and consternation depicted on his face, then yelled
out, &ldquo;O blessed St Bridget, they mean to kill me
this night. Sure, they&rsquo;ve mounted one hundred
bally sentries, and they can&rsquo;t all miss me.&rdquo; With
that he reeled away, looking over his shoulder and,
still yelling his shibboleth of &ldquo;Friend, friend!&rdquo; ran
to earth in the welcome portal of his stronghold.
This spectacle was too much for the risibility of
the parade; officers and men went into a roar of
laughter, which could not be checked for some
time.</p>

<p>Next morning the doctor was informed he must
resign or stand a court-martial. He did the former,
and we got rid of him, while he retired to some
place where he could indulge in his favourite pastime
without running into danger from a murderous
sentry or of the unkind remarks of a censorious
commanding officer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small>HOW KIWI SAVED HIS CLOTHES</small></h2>


<p>New Zealand is, of course, famous for its natural
beauties and wonders, among them the hot lakes
and the terraces of pink and gleaming white stone.
The latter, unfortunately, were destroyed by
volcanic eruption in the eighties, but, I believe, are
forming again.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 80%;">
<img src="images/i_218.jpg" width="100%" alt="TE TARATA: THE FAMOUS WHITE TERRACES, ROTOMAHANA." title="" />
<span class="caption">TE TARATA: THE FAMOUS WHITE TERRACES, ROTOMAHANA.</span>
</div>

<p>On one occasion when I was located in the hot
lake district several prominent Colonial officials,
with their wives, came up, and I had to show them
round. On Lake Rotorua we had two large whale-boats,
and it was arranged that the party should be
taken along the lake in these, to the island Mokoia,
the scene of the romantic story of O Hinemoa
and Tutanekai (the Maori Hero and Leander).
The Maori yarn differs from the Greek, as
it was the young lady who did the swimming
part of the business, and the hussy was not
drowned.</p>

<p>Mokoia has also been the scene of ruddy war,
for it was on this island the Arawa tribe took refuge
from a dreadful raid of the Ngapuhi tribe, under
that bloodthirsty monster Hongi, who, from the
year 1818-1838, raged through the North Island
of New Zealand like a plague, and destroyed over
one-fourth of its inhabitants.</p>

<p>He was one of the first Maoris who visited
England, having been brought there by Kendal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
to help Professor Lee with his Maori grammar
and dictionary. While in England he was much
lionised, and received many valuable gifts.</p>

<p>He was presented to George IV., who made him
presents of a suit of armour and other valuable
articles.</p>

<p>On his return to Sidney he sold all his presents,
with the exception of the suit of armour, and
bought 300 muskets with ammunition. While in
Sidney a grim story is told of him. At Kendal&rsquo;s
dinner-table he met another Maori chief belonging
to a tribe hostile to the Ngapuhi. Quoth he to his
fellow-guest: &ldquo;Go home, make ready for war, and
prepare to be killed and eaten.&rdquo; Landing in New
Zealand, he swept the country bare, killing
thousands and eating all he could. At last came
the turn of the Arawa.</p>

<p>Sweeping down the east coast, he landed at
Maketu and twice defeated the Arawa, who retired
inland and took refuge in their stronghold, the
island of Mokoia. He followed them and camped
on the edge of the lake. Every morning the
Arawa, confident in their fancied security, used to
paddle past his camp and cheek him. I do not
know if they used to place their thumbs to their
noses and stretch their fingers out at him, but they
poked fun at him and asked him rude questions,
such as: How did he expect to come to Makoia?
Was he growing wings like a duck, or, perchance,
fins like a fish? etc., etc.</p>

<p>Naught would reply the grim old warrior, as he
sat, surrounded by his cannibal chiefs, on the high
bank of the lake, to his enemy&rsquo;s ribaldry; but he
took the opportunity to tapu the splendid canoes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
as they dashed past him, the jeering crews showing
them off to the best advantage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My skull is the bailing pot of that canoe,&rdquo; said
Hongi, pointing to the largest and best one. This
was a most awful assertion, but it rendered that
canoe sacred to Hongi, as who, at the division of
spoil, could claim a canoe the bailing pot of which
was Hongi&rsquo;s skull, the most tapu part of his body.</p>

<p>This went on day after day, while Hongi was
having his big war canoes transported from the
sea, up creeks, across land, over a range of bushed
hills, and through lakes to the scene of action.</p>

<p>First of all up a creek, then he had a road cut
through a forest, covering a range of hills, until he
launched them on Lake Roto Ehu. Again, he cut
a road through a forest, and launched them on Lake
Roto Iti and then up a rapid creek till they emerged
on Lake Roto Rua. Now, poor Arawa, you will find
out to your cost how Hongi is coming to Mokoia!</p>

<p>One morning, as the Arawa were preparing for
their usual daily amusement, they saw, to their
horror and consternation, the advancing fleet of
their bloodthirsty enemies. The time for jeering
and laughter had passed, some tried to escape and
a few succeeded, the others stood and fought the
hopeless fight of spears and stones versus muskets.
The canoes drew near the island and Hongi
opening fire on the hapless defenders, shot them
down in heaps, then, landing, killed or enslaved all
that remained of the Arawa tribe. The ovens,
surrounded with the crumbling bones of the victims,
remain still to mark the spot where scores of the
unfortunate Arawa were cooked and eaten; and
these, with Ohinemoa&rsquo;s natural hot bath, are the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
two show places on the beautiful green hill that sits
like a gem on the bosom of the dark blue lake.</p>

<p>After we had visited Mokoia we were to descend
the rapid creek up which Hongi had brought his
canoes and inspect Roto Iti. The boats were
manned by young Maoris of splendid physique,
whom I dressed for the occasion very prettily, in
shirts and trousers of white cotton, with black silk
neckerchiefs. They were very proud of themselves
in these smart, unaccustomed clothes.</p>

<p>When we came to the shallow water, at the head
of the creek, it would be necessary for these fellows
to jump out of the boat to lighten her, and drag
her over into deep water; and I warned them that
as English ladies did not like to see men without
clothes on they must jump overboard in their smart
suits. The three officials went into one of the
boats by themselves, with a crew that knew no
English, as they wanted to discuss important
business, and I escorted the ladies in the other
boat. We landed at Mokoia, and I showed them
the bath and the gruesome ovens, and told them
the tales of love and war, and then we re-embarked
to visit Roto Iti. All went well till we reached
the shallows at the head of the creek; here the
boat grounded and I ordered the crew overboard
to push her along.</p>

<p>All obeyed and plunged in with their clothes
on, as instructed, with one exception. This was
the stroke oar, a fine young Maori named Kiwi,
who spoke broken English and was the son of
a principal chief. He was very proud of his smart
new clothes, and when the other fellows sprang
into the water he sat tight. His mates called to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
him for help, and seeing he did not move I ordered
him overboard. But he meant to preserve that
suit. With a deep sigh he took off the black silk
neckerchief, next he stripped off that immaculate
white shirt. He looked at the water, and then
at his lovely white trousers.</p>

<p>Then, with sudden inspiration, he touched the
principal lady on the shoulder and said in a deep
whisper of despair: &ldquo;You no like to see me: you
look that way.&rdquo; And in another moment he had
whipped off his last thread of clothing and joined
his comrades in the water.</p>


<p>THE LOST DINNER</p>

<p>Some time after the New Zealand wars ended
Pierre de Feugeron settled down at a Maori village
called Wairoa, situated at the head of Lake
Tarawera, and there built himself a two-roomed
shanty, which he called the Maison de Repos, and
offered to entertain any tourists visiting the wonders
of Rotomahana.</p>

<p>Now Pierre was a miraculous cook. He could
make a good dinner out of anything, and there
is no doubt he would have done well but for his
great failing, Drink&mdash;in his case spelt with a very,
very big D. For no sooner had he been remunerated
by one lot of tourists than he would at once
make off to Ohinimutu, where there was a drink
shanty, and blow the lot.</p>

<p>He was indeed a queer character. In appearance,
he was big enough, and looked ferocious
enough, for a stage brigand, wearing his hair long
and a huge beard. In reality he was as kind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>-hearted
and simple as a child, and, notwithstanding
his past life of bloodshed and adventure, he was
just as harmless as one.</p>

<p>Pierre was also great on politics, in more ways
than one, for his special brand would depend on
the number of tots he had absorbed.</p>

<p>When sober he was a Legitimist, after he had
had a drink or two an Imperialist, a few more
made a Republican of him, and as he got full up
he became a Communist, an Anarchist and a
ruddy Red. At this stage he would become an awe-inspiring
object indeed. Armed with a tomahawk
in one hand and a huge knife in the other, he
would dance a war-dance of the most blood-curdling
description, and with rolling r&rsquo;s emit
horrible wild yells, in French, broken English and
Maori, sufficient, unless you had known him, to
daunt the courage of Bayard himself. Yet when
the non-com. on duty considered that Pierre had
<i>ranged</i> himself enough, he only had to send a
Maori kid to him, with the intimation that the
guardroom required him, and Pierre, dropping the
Bombastes Furioso business, would immediately
make a bee-line for that hospitable abode and fall
asleep, sobbing over the sorrows of La Belle
France.</p>

<p>Well, it was my duty to escort round the hot
lakes any big pot the Government chose to send
up to me, and the Governor, once a year, used
to come round, with a large party, and visit the
wonders of the district, which, of course, included
the marvellous terraces.</p>

<p>A noble marquis was at this time proconsul
in New Zealand, and when I received warning of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
his advent I also received the straight tip that
his Excellency, a <i>bon-vivant</i>, dearly loved a good
dinner, so I determined he should have nothing
to complain of while under my care.</p>

<p>Now it was customary for the Governor to camp
a night at Wairoa <i>en route</i> to the terraces, and
also to stay another night there on the return
journey, so I determined, albeit with grave doubts,
to engage Pierre to take charge of the culinary
department for the two nights we should be
there.</p>

<p>For the first night I had no anxieties, as I had
kept Pierre closely confined to the guardroom for
the preceding fortnight; but I was very nervous
about the day that I should be at the terraces with
the party, when Pierre, perchance getting hold of
some of the liquor, might raise Cain and wreck the
dinner. However, I put my trust in Providence,
and also in the discretion and vigilance of the
reliable old non-com. who would be left in charge
of the camp during my absence, and to whom I
gave instructions to keep a very sharp eye on
Pierre and his movements; so, hoping for the best,
I received his Excellency with equanimity.</p>

<p>The first night all went well. Pierre served up
such a <i>recherch&eacute;</i> dinner that the Governor sent
for him to be congratulated, and in his enthusiasm
offered the old chap a drink. Alas! I dare not
interfere, though well I knew this meant trouble;
for the first tot to Pierre was like the first taste
of blood to a tiger.</p>

<p>Pierre picked up a bottle of brandy, and pouring
out a bosu&rsquo;n&rsquo;s nip, drank it off to the health of ze
Governor, ze Great Queen Victoria, and ze Great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
Napoleon, and then took himself off, but, <i>horrible
dictu</i>, he also took the bottle with him.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, just at that moment my whole
attention was drawn from him by a lady questioning
me about his adventures, so he escaped with
his plunder without my observing the act.</p>

<p>I left the table as soon as possible, and sought
out Pierre, whom I found walking about on his
tiptoes, looking scornfully at the troopers, while
he informed them that he himself was Pierre de
Feugeron, ze grand scout. He also demanded their
attention, that he himself, and no other man, was
Pierre de Feugeron, ze grand <i>cordon-bleu</i>, who
had cooked dinners for the Emperor, and that the
great Reine Victoria had sent for him to cook ze
dinner for herself. Le Bon Dieu save ze Queen,
ip ip&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He had just reached this stage when I reached
for him, and ze grand <i>cordon-bleu</i> retired at the
double to his hut; but, alas! I knew nothing about
that plundered bottle, which he had planted before
my advent.</p>

<p>The next morning, after an early breakfast,
and after I had reiterated my cautions to the
non-com., and my warnings and threats to
Pierre, we started in canoes for Rotomahana,
where the Governor and his party enjoyed themselves
thoroughly, returning in the evening to
Wairoa.</p>

<p>Now I must confess that although I placed
great faith in both Providence and the non-com.,
yet Black Care sat on my soul like a wet
blanket; and this would have been considerably
enhanced had I but known that a sudden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
stampede of the horses had forced away the
non-com. and his men, leaving Pierre alone
in camp to work his wicked will. All the way
back in the canoes the conversation turned on
gastronomy, and his Excellency, well pleased with
the day and having a forty-dollar appetite, looked
forward to his dinner, and hoped it would be as
good as the one on the previous night. I hoped
so too; but coming events cast their shadows before
them, and I had my doubts.</p>

<p>At last we landed and climbed the steep hill
that led to the flat on which the camp was pitched.
Alas! while still afar off I heard the wild war-whoops
and blood-curdling yells I knew so well,
and was assured that my very worst apprehensions
were more than justified.</p>

<p>I at once pushed on, the Governor accompanying
me, and on our reaching the camp there was our
<i>cordon-bleu</i>, armed as per usual, dancing a war-dance
that would have excited the envious admiration
of a crazy Hau Hau.</p>

<p>The Governor paused for a moment, and stood
aghast in astonishment at the horrible-looking
object before us, then full of pluck, for of course he
did not know how utterly harmless the old fellow
was, rushed up to him and said soothingly: &ldquo;Pierre,
how goes the dinner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pierre briefly answered that the dinner had gone
to a place where it must have been overcooked
and spoilt long ago.</p>

<p>But quoth his Excellency: &ldquo;I am so hungry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a ruddy good job too,&rdquo; howled Pierre.
&ldquo;It is good for kings and governors to be hungry.
I myself am Pierre de Feugeron, the great Com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>munist.
I myself am Pierre de Feugeron, the noble
anarchist, and I scorn to cook the dinners of kings
and governors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then seeing the rest of the party, who by this
time had arrived and were regarding him with awe
and astonishment, he at once consigned the
Governor and the rest of us to the same place as
he had committed the dinner, and was proceeding
with his <i>pas seul</i> when some Maoris, acting on
my instructions, took a hand in the game. Exit
the noble anarchist, to be tied to a tree for the night,
to regain his loyalty, while I had to bustle about
to knock up an impromptu dinner for my sorrowing
and shocked guests.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />

<small>A SOUTH SEA BUBBLE</small></h2>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;So we found no copper island, nor rapid fortunes made,<br />
But by strictly honest trading a dividend we paid.<br />
And Maori Browne converted, with an ancient flint-lock gun,<br />
A mob of ruddy pagans, beneath the southern sun.&rdquo;<br />
</p>


<p>I was in Auckland with a lot of spare time on my
hands. I had come down-country intending to go
over to Australia, but, having been stuck up by a
flooded river for two days, I had missed my boat,
and consequently was planted there, as boats at
that time were neither so numerous nor ran so
often as they do now.</p>

<p>On the morning after my arrival I was strolling
down Queen&rsquo;s Street, wondering what I was to do
with myself, when I was hailed from the other side
of the road, and, looking in the direction from which
the coo-ee came, I at once recognised the long red
nose and brilliant scarlet hair of a man who had
been our regimental surgeon during the past wars.
His had been a hard case. Out and out the best
medical man we had in our service, as far as professional
knowledge and skill went, he was still a
born fighting man, and was always more anxious,
while under fire, to damage the enemy than to
repair friends. This inclination was somewhat
held in check and restrained by the Roman
Catholic chaplain, a great pal of his who was always
in the firing line doing the best he could for any
wounded man, be he papist or heretic.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, one day while on a patrol along the east
coast, we had a scrap with a few Maoris, and the
doctor, who happened to be with us, to his huge
delight, killed one. Now I do not for a moment
want to assert that this was the first man the doctor
had ever killed. He had, doubtless, during the
practice of his profession, killed very many, but it
was the first Hau Hau who had ever fallen to his
carbine; for, although a brilliant medico, he was a
vile shot, and the dear doctor was greatly elated,
so much so that he determined to have a trophy
in commemoration of the event. Now the Maori
was a fine big fellow of some rank, and had the
skin on his thighs magnificently tattooed, so the
doctor, wanting a <i>spolia opima, faute de mieux</i>
flayed off and preserved the tattooed portions of
the bounder&rsquo;s epidermis, which he cured and subsequently
had made into a tobacco pouch. He
was very proud of this pouch, and was fond of exhibiting
it and making people to whom he showed
it guess from what material it was manufactured.</p>

<p>He did so once too often; for one night after
dining well, though not wisely, he exhibited it in the
smoking-room of the club at Wellington. The
same official was present whose son&rsquo;s leg-bone was
afterwards annexed and turned into a flute. He
was at that time posing as a goody-goody minister;
and, pretending to be shocked, brought such pressure
to bear that he forced the medico to resign; and so
we lost the services of our best doctor, and the
company of a thundering good fellow. All this
had happened some time before, and I had not seen
him for over a year. We had been great friends,
and I was under great obligations to him, as he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
had on several occasions mended me after I had
been broken, and had even saved me my left leg
when two other sawbones wanted to amputate it.
So you can easily understand I was delighted to
meet him, and we at once adjourned to Perkins&rsquo;s
saloon and proceeded to wet this auspicious meeting.</p>

<p>Well, no sooner had we lowered our first cocktail
than the doctor demanded what I was doing in
Auckland, and on my telling him I had lost my
boat he expressed unfeeling delight and thanked
Providence for sending and detaining me, as I was
the very man he wanted, and I must take charge
of a party he had raised to search the South Seas
for a copper island.</p>

<p>Now I had not lost a copper island, and should
not have known what to do with it if I found one,
yet the very mention of the South Seas allured me
like a honey-pot to a wasp.</p>

<p>Then as he went on to open out his plans, and
tell me the names of the men who had joined him
in his scheme, most of whom I knew well, I saw at
once, copper island or no copper island, there was
every chance of a rollicking good time. So when
the men dropped in by twos and threes, Perkins&rsquo;s
saloon being their rendezvous, and all of them joining
the doctor in persuading me, I quite gave way
and consented to join with them and take command.</p>

<p>A case of champagne was quickly ordered and
consumed, drinking luck to the venture, and I found
myself chief of forty as reckless, devil-may-care filibusters
as ever banded themselves together. Do
not think, dear reader, we were going to hoist Jolly
Roger, or anything of that sort. No, we were
going to search through some of the least-frequented<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
groups of islands to find one of pure copper, and we
were all to return fabulously rich.</p>

<p>If we could not find the copper island, we might
yet find something else of value, and even failing
that we would trade with the islanders, gentle or
otherwise, for b&ecirc;che-de-mer, whales&rsquo; teeth, or anything
else we thought could be disposed of to
our advantage. Trade, I say, not take; we signed
articles as Gentlemen Adventurers with every liberty
but no licence.</p>

<p>We were, moreover, all of us highly respectable,
very moral and well-brought-up young men. Every
one of us had served and seen years of active
service, so all knew the value of discipline. Most
of us were public school boys, and although we
might have found ourselves <i>de trop</i> at an Exeter
Hall spring meeting tea-party, yet we were quite
fit to take our places and shine in the beau-monde
that at that period graced the South Seas.</p>

<p>Our party for the above purpose had chartered
a very large and powerful American schooner, with
a skipper, a Yankee who knew the South Seas
well, and who turned out to be a rattling good
fellow, two mates, a brace of cooks, a few China
boys as flunkeys, and we worked her ourselves.
Strict discipline was to be maintained. Every one
of us had put a considerable sum of money into the
venture; we all knew one another well, and two
days after I had met the doctor we went to sea
well armed, well found, and as good a crowd as
ever set sail, without a single rotter amongst
us.</p>

<p>Well, one lovely morning we got our anchor and
glided out of the splendid harbour before a fine, fair<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
wind, made our offing, then, setting every inch of
muslin, started on our quest.</p>

<p>The schooner proved herself to be very fast,
and also, a few days afterwards, in a bit of a blow,
showed herself, although a trifle wet, yet on the
whole to be a really good sea boat. The skipper
and mates not only proved themselves good seamen,
but good fellows; so we were all well contented
and looked forward to great profit and more fun.</p>

<p>Those were the days when a man yearning for
excitement could have his fill in the South Seas.
Everyone there did what he liked, unless a stronger
man prevented him.</p>

<p>Those were the days when Bully Hayes, in his
lovely brigantine, <i>Leonora</i>, swept the seas and
established a funk in everyone not too strong or
too poor to fear him.</p>

<p>Bully Bragg was still to the fore. The infamous
brig, <i>Karl</i>, and the psalm-singing Scotch scoundrel
who owned her had not yet been found out, and there
were plenty more black bird-catchers, sandalwood
traders and others always ready to grab and take
anything, provided they were strong enough to do so.</p>

<p>We had, however, nothing to fear from savage or
picaroon: we were a strong party, with plenty of
arms, and all of us well able to use them. We
wished to interfere with no one, and whoever interfered
with us must take the consequence. So we
sailed on, enjoying the day and careless of the
morrow.</p>

<p>If I were to write half of what happened to us on
that glorious trip it would fill books.</p>

<p>We met Bully Hayes and hobnobbed with him,
finding him the most obliging and courteous of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
men. But then we carried two twelve-pounders
and fifty good rifles, so we deserved fair treatment,
and received it. We landed on very many of the
islands, and saw a good deal of the natives. Their
conduct was mixed. So was ours. We paid well
for everything we required in the way of wood,
water and fresh provisions, when they were civil
to us, and when they were the other thing we still
took our requirements, and they took the other
thing. So we sailed on, strong in the knowledge
of our rectitude and integrity, and confident in our
ability to take care of ourselves.</p>

<p>Well, we had a rollicking good time of it. But
we did not find that copper island, nor anything
else we wanted of any great value. We therefore
turned our attention to trading, in which peaceful
pursuit we were very successful.</p>

<p>Our strength in numbers, our discipline, and our
skill with our weapons, overawing most of the
savage islanders, enabled us to put in with impunity
to places where smaller parties dared not
have ventured, and also ensured us fair treatment,
a good market and prompt payment. So we
prospered as gentlemen adventurers of a highly
moral tone deserve to.</p>

<p>One day we put in to an island where half the
people, under the guidance of an old American
missionary, had turned into what they called
Christians, the remaining half still retaining their
ancient superstitions.</p>

<p>The missionary was a dear, good old chap, as
simple and confiding as a child, and it was very
difficult to understand how such a cute nation as
America could have produced such a man. I do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
not know to what brand of fancy religion he belonged,
but he was not Church of England or
Roman Catholic. Anyhow, he was a good man,
and we respected him accordingly.</p>

<p>Now in a bit of a blow we had had a few days
before we had been somewhat damaged, and seeing
that the lagoon in which we were anchored was
a very safe one, and the natives fairly civil, our
skipper determined to remain a few days to complete
the necessary repairs. So we landed a lot of
stores, and started trading for b&ecirc;che-de-mer, which
animal the natives caught in large quantities.</p>

<p>During our trading I made the acquaintance of
the head devil dodger of the pagan crowd, and
found him to be not half a bad old fellow. He was,
naturally, rather bitter at the desertion of the half
of his parishioners, and gave me to understand
that his tithes had so decreased that he could
barely make a living, and that the island was not,
in his opinion, large enough to support two rival
churches. So, judging I was a knowledgeable man,
he asked my advice on this point. He also requested
my active assistance to aid him in his endeavours
to regain his rightful emoluments and status.</p>

<p>His first proposal was that he should kill his
rival sky-pilot; but that I forbade, and impressed
on him the fact that if he hurt the missionary a
ship of war would quickly come and blow him and
his island galley west. He next proposed that I,
to show my friendship, should oblige him so far
as to kill the missionary for him. This proposition
was, of course, decidedly negatived. Then he
suggested that I should at least shoot the boss
convert, the next cause of my old friend&rsquo;s trouble.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
Again I had to refuse, and explained to him that the
quarrel was not mine, and that the white man&rsquo;s God
only allowed us to kill one another in pukka (war).</p>

<p>Then he requested the loan of my rifle to do
the deed with himself; but I opened the breech
and let him look down the barrel, explaining to
him that only a Christian could use that weapon,
as a heathen, not possessing the spirit of the true
faith, might receive damage from the breech. He
shook his head and intimated that it was a weary,
weary world and full of disappointments. But an
old flint-lock musket among the trade goods catching
his eye, he begged to examine it, and seeing it
had no opening at the breech he at once said that
it was the very weapon he had dreamed of with
which to right his wrongs. Would I give it him?</p>

<p>I am not a business man, but yet I suggested
that I should like payment for it in b&ecirc;che-de-mer
or whales&rsquo; teeth. Alas! he was a poor man, he
had none; but would I not lend him the gun, just
to shoot one Christian with? I pointed out the
dangers he ran in attempting to do such a thing.
The mana (spirit) of the Christian God was far
stronger than the mana of his pagan ancestors, and
most likely if I lent him the musket it would only
bring trouble on himself, and he would be sorry for
it. He, however, refused to grasp my reasoning,
sound as it was; so knowing quite well what would
happen, I lent him the old flint-lock. He was
delighted, and promptly borrowed two handfuls of
coarse black powder to feed it with. These he
carefully poured down it, then rammed home
various chunks of coral, pebbles, etc., topping up
with a fid of rag.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>At my earnest request he moved a short
distance from my camp, to a spot where he dug a
shallow hole in the sand, in which he lay dogo,
and waited with great patience for his Christian
friend to come along. Towards evening come
along he did. I knew the bounder by sight and I
did not admire him. Christianity, as a rule, does
not improve the manners of the gentle savage, and
it certainly had not added to this Johnny&rsquo;s stock of
humility, for he swaggered along with as much
side as a new-made Lance Jack, bumptious cheek
being written all over him, in fact he looked the
very quintessence of insolence and cheap pride.</p>

<p>Presently he arrived within a few yards of the spot
where Nemesis awaited him, and where he was to
receive a shock that was to fill him with the fear
of the Lord for a considerable period of time.</p>

<p>Yes, indeed he was just within a yard or two of
the little heap of sand that masked the old devil
dodger&rsquo;s ambush when that ancient worthy rose up
and, holding the old gun out at the full stretch of
both arms, shut his eyes, pulled the trigger and
let go. For a moment the powder fizzled in the
touch hole, then off it went with the report and
recoil of a 32-pounder. Where the charge went
the Lord only knows, but the report, flame and
smoke were quite enough for the Christian. He
turned and fled, and went round the bay, at a pace
that would have won him any Marathon race
record in the world; and the last thing I saw of him
was a black dot on the white beach, disappearing
round a far cape and still travelling as if the devil
had kicked him edgeways.</p>

<p>If the report had upset the equanimity of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
convert, the recoil had been equally deadly to the
equilibrium of the pagan. Struck full in the face
by the heel-plate of the old gun, he turned at least
three back somersaults; and when he came to the
conviction that he was still on this planet he rose
up, and after straightening out and arranging his
scattered features, he went and looked at the old
musket, and solemnly cursed it for at least ten
minutes. Then seeing it was now in a state of
quietude, he gingerly picked it up and, holding it
at arm&rsquo;s-length, brought it to me and handed it
back, remarking sadly, with a shake of his head:
&ldquo;This gun is no good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here I joined issue with him, and declared it
to be a very good gun indeed. Had it not
knocked him over and over again, and that with
the peaceful end of it? Had it not made him
see more stars in a few minutes than he had ever
before seen in his whole life? And if that was
the case to himself, had not even the talk of it
caused his enemy to run faster and farther than
any mortal man had ever been known to run before?
Well, then, how much more damage would it not have
done, with its business end, had it only been directed
by a man who possessed proper mana in proportion
to the strength of the gun? No, the gun was a
good gun, and the fault clearly lay with himself.</p>

<p>Again I not pointed him out the dangers he ran
in attacking a Christian? Had I not assured him
that the mana of the white man&rsquo;s God was far
stronger than the mana of his pagan deities? Had
he believed me and taken my advice? No. Then
who was to blame? Why, undoubtedly himself;
and consequently he had suffered for it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>This he was forced to allow, but then the same
question cropped up again. What was to be
done? Could I not give him some sound advice?
Why, certainly. The best course he could pursue
would be for himself and people to at once turn
Christians, and then, if they obeyed the missionary
implicitly, they would soon make up the leeway of
mana that the others had acquired, and he would
be on the same plane as the other josser.</p>

<p>To this he agreed, and swore he and his people
would be converted right away, and started off hot-toe
to summon them.</p>

<p>I had just finished telling my comrades about my
first attempt at converting the heathen when who
should appear but his Reverence himself, in a
terrible state of fluster.</p>

<p>Approaching me, he said sorrowfully: &ldquo;Surely
I am misinformed: surely you did not lend a
musket to one of these heathens with which to
kill one of my dear Christian converts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I pleaded guilty. &ldquo;Is it not written,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;&lsquo;He that lendeth to the poor giveth to the Lord&rsquo;?
This poor chap hadn&rsquo;t a musket of his own so I
lent him one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dear old fellow was very much shocked,
but I convinced him that I was fully aware no
harm would come from my perhaps injudicious
kindness; and finally, on the appearance of my
old friend, the knight of the rueful countenance,
with his leading people, who one and all
declared that they were convinced of the power of
the Christian God, and that they were all both
anxious and willing to join his flock, his sorrow
turned to gladness, and he declared that Providence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
worked in wondrous ways, and that now he was
convinced that our visit had been a great blessing
to his community, although he had had at first
grave doubts upon the subject. He also returned
thanks for the sudden and wonderful conversion of
the heathen, and declared that now the whole
island would become the home of one happy family,
living together in peace and harmony. I had my
doubts; but he was such a good old fellow that we
all turned to and built him a swagger church, and
endowed it with a spare ship&rsquo;s bell we had on
board.</p>

<p>So that when we left the dear old innocent took
a tearful farewell of us and gave us his blessing;
and a really good man&rsquo;s blessing, like a tinker&rsquo;s
cuss, does no one any harm. He also prophesied
we should all meet again in heaven; but there
again I have grave doubts, as I fancy most of our
crew were making for a more tropical latitude.</p>

<p>Well, I have never heard of that island since the
day we left it, and I have even forgotten its name;
but I have always felt uncertain about the happy-family
part of the business, and fear his Reverence
was premature in the thanks he gave concerning
it. For on the day we left, on my presenting the
exdevil dodger with an American axe, as a parting
gift, he gravely informed me that he felt the mana
of the Christians rising so strongly within him that
as soon as he had acquired a few more hymns and
prayers he should feel strong enough to have
another go at his enemy, and he thought, this time,
he would fetch him, especially as my beautiful
present would provide him with a beau-ideal
weapon that would do its work quietly and not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
kick back and destroy its innocent proprietor. I
may therefore be forgiven for my doubts on the
brotherhood, peace and harmony of that happy
family.</p>

<p>I have never tried to convert any heathens since,
but I sincerely hope that my one attempt proved,
in the long run, as profitable as our trip to the
South Seas did for us. But may I again remark,
I hae ma doots.</p>

<p>Of course ninety-nine out of every hundred old
war dogs who have the misfortune to retain their
pristine longing for hard work and an active life,
when they are rapidly approaching the allotted
threescore years and ten of their existence, and
maybe, like the writer, are incapacitated by rheumatism,
sciatica, tic-doloreux, housemaid&rsquo;s knee,
liver and the hump from ever participating again
in such sports as their hearts yearn for but their
age and infirmities render impracticable, sit down,
and, instead of employing their remaining years in
making their souls, grouse and grumble at their
bad luck, blaming everyone except themselves
(<i>bien entendu</i>) for their bad luck, and maybe
poverty, entirely forgetting the glorious years they
put in when they were able to lead a charge, rush
a kopje, or back a bucking horse with the best.
Yes, and they are prone to belittle, and perhaps to
undervalue, the men who have shouldered them
out and taken their places in the fighting line,
and who are at present responsible for and are
upholding the honour of our gracious King and
glorious old flag on the frontiers of our splendid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
Empire. &ldquo;Yes, by gad, sir,&rdquo; growls one old war
dog to another, &ldquo;these present men are not worth
their salt, sir. They should have been with us,
sir, fifty years ago, then they would have known
what privations and hand-to-hand fighting meant.
Nowadays they are fitted out with flat trajectory
magazine rifles, Maxim guns, pom-poms, and the
Lord only knows what else, while we had to fight
with old muzzle-loading rifles, sneiders or Martini-Henry&rsquo;s
that were always jamming, etc., etc., etc.&rdquo;
Grouse, grumble, grouse: and so they go on <i>ad
infinitum</i>.</p>

<p>Yes, it is very true men who are approaching the
age-limit of threescore years and ten had in their
early manhood to fight with inferior rifles to those
that our gallant troops are armed with at present,
and, speaking from personal experience, deuced good
weapons we thought them, and were always game
and happy enough to use them when luck sent any
fighting our way. Well, I have no doubt that in
those days our seniors were making the same
remarks and passing similar strictures on us, that
we nowadays are passing on our successors, and
as they in their turn will bestow on theirs. Still
there is no doubt that, thanks to science and the
enormous expenditure of cash, the lot of the present-day
fighting-man is infinitely better than it was
fifty years ago, while far more men and much
better material were employed on a war of conquest
during the sixties and the seventies of the last
century than were deemed necessary fifty years previously;
in fact you may say it has been so way back
to the days of romance, when Samson used to play
a lone hand against the Philistines, or even when Sir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
Galahad and his compeers used to start out holy-grailing,
giant-killing, dragon-hunting or lovely-maiden-rescuing.
True, there are nothing like the
hardships in modern wars there were in those
of the past, although I opine that the Turks have
just had about as bad a time of it as ever men
wanted to face; but then it has been sharp, quick
and soon over, and entirely due to their rotten
Government allowing them to be caught on the hop.
(Please God the precious gang who at present misrule
our country will not put us into a like hole.)
Still I doubt very much at the present day if you
could get troops of any nation to voluntarily face
the hardships that Pizarro&rsquo;s men had to undergo
during the conquest of Peru, or any of our young
sybaritic loungers to don aluminium waistcoats
(much less steel ones) and go for a jaunt crusading
as their hardy ancestors did. But, mark time, the
majority of the progenitors of our nowadays gilded
youths were in those times trading in old clo&rsquo;s or
doing a bit of stiff and not wearing metal vests and
unmentionables at all at all.</p>

<p>However, we will pass over the good ould toimes,
when a rale fighting-man had no need to insure
himself with Lloyd George against unemployment,
and comedown to the nineteenth century&mdash;in fact the
years 1838-1839, when there were but few English
in Natal, and the black fiend, Dingaan, who had
murdered his brother Tshaka, ruled the roost in
Zululand with his army of 50,000 bloodthirsty
warriors. I am not writing a book on the history
of Natal, but, as 999 out of every 1000 Englishmen
have probably never heard of Tshaka or Dingaan,
and are just as ignorant of the struggles of the early<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
Settlers in the garden colony of South Africa,
I may state that, although Natal was not officially
occupied by British troops till 1842, when
Captain Smith of the 27th Regiment marched there
with a portion of his corps and a detachment of
artillery and built a fort near Kongella, in which he
was speedily surrounded and besieged by the trek
Boers under Pretorius: yet small parties of Englishmen
(good Lost Legionaries every one of them) had
years previously taken root in the vicinity of where
Durban now stands, where they carried on the
usual pioneer pursuits, such as hunting and trading
with the natives. Yes; they had taken root, and
meant to hold their own and stick to their foothold
in the country, notwithstanding the jealousy and
secret enmity of large parties of trek Boers, who
were crowding into Natal for the purpose of forming
a Dutch republic there. Well, the year 1838 had
been a hot one for the Boer trekkers, as in the early
part of it Pieter Retief, a chief, one of their most influential
commandants, together with seventy picked
Boers and from thirty to forty picked Hottentots,
having visited Dingaan&rsquo;s kraal for the purpose of
making a treaty, were inveigled, unarmed, into the
cattle enclosure, overpowered and brutally murdered.</p>

<p>This act of treachery the savage monster quickly
followed up with a lightning raid into Natal, during
which over 600 Boers, men, women and children,
were butchered with fiendish barbarity. This raid
he continued down to Port Natal, where the aforementioned
few Englishmen were forced to take
refuge on board two ships that, providentially,
happened to be in the harbour. Later on in the
year the Boer War punitive expedition, under the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
celebrated commandant Piet Uys, were ambushed
and badly worsted, having to fall back, with the loss
of their O.C. and many men, so that the year 1838
is still regarded by the Dutch inhabitants of South
Africa as a very black year indeed.</p>

<p>Now the Zulu raid to Port Natal had upset the
equilibrium of the English settlers, who, being
moreover very savage at the losses they had sustained,
determined to pay back the Zulu potentate
in his own coin. First of all they volunteered to
join Piet Uys&rsquo; commando, but as he entered Zululand
from the north they were left behind, and so
determined to form a punitive column of their own.</p>

<p>And, now I have reeled off this prosy prelude, let
me tell you how it was I first heard of the exploits
of the first band of English Lost Legionaries, who,
although fighting for their own hand, made the
English pioneers in Natal respected and feared
by both Boer and savage, while the story also convinced
your humble servant that, no matter how
good he fancied himself and his lambs to be, still, in
the near past, there were better and more daring
men tailing on to the halyards of the Old Rag than
either he individually or all his flock collectively
were. And now let me trek.</p>

<p>It was during the latter end of December 1878,
just previous to the Zulu War, and forty years after
the aforementioned incidents had occurred in Natal
history, that I was trekking through the Thorn
Country from Grey Town to Rourke&rsquo;s Drift,
together with the staff of the 3rd N.N.C., and
we were camped for the day on the banks of the
Tugela River, when there arrived, at the same
outspan, an old interior trader, trekking out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
Zululand. Now, as I was particularly anxious to
gain all the information I could about that country,
I entered into conversation with him, and eventually
he accepted my invitation to come over to my
waggon, have some lunch and a yarn. Tiffin having
been discussed and pipes lit we were chatting on
the probabilities of the coming war when he noticed
my M.H. sporting carbine and heavy B.L. revolver
that my servant had just cleaned, and at once
requested permission to examine them. After he
had done so, and I had explained to him the
mechanism of the carbine and the flatness of its
trajectory in comparison with the sneider with
which he himself was armed, he heaved a sigh, and
handing back the weapon said: &ldquo;Ah, if the first
English army that invaded Zululand had been
provided with such guns, instead of old flint
muskets, they might have won the day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Smelling a yarn I replied: &ldquo;I thought no English
army had ever invaded Zululand up to date.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My guest smole the pitying smile that an old-timer
usually employs when a new chum exhibits
his ignorance or puts his foot into it and queried:
&ldquo;Did you ever hear of Cane?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; quoth I; &ldquo;if you mean the cockatoo
agriculturist who had the first row with the boss
of the original sheep-raising industry, I have
heard of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; responded my companion; &ldquo;the party I
allude to was no relation of his&mdash;did not even
spell his name the same way, though both of them
were handy with their dukes, and prone to go for
their neighbours when riled. By the way, what is
the strength of your invading force?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;about 6000 white men and an
equal number of natives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I suppose,&rdquo; queried he, &ldquo;all your white
men are armed with M.H. rifles, and that you will
take three or four batteries of artillery, rockets, etc.,
and that a percentage of your natives will be
armed with rifles?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I nodded assent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;the first English army
which invaded Zululand, when Dingaan was at the
zenith of his power, consisted of 18 Englishmen,
perhaps half-a-dozen Dutchmen, 30 Hottentots and
about 3000 Natal Kafirs, and they had only 400
old M.L. muskets to the whole outfit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, come,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re trying to pull my
leg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Devil a bit,&rdquo; said he. Then he spun me the
following yarn, which anyone may verify by
perusing the late Mr D. C. F. Moodie&rsquo;s book,
&ldquo;The History of the Battles and Adventures of
the British, the Boers and the Zulus in South
Africa,&rdquo; from which volume I have not only
refreshed my memory, but have cribbed many
paragraphs, which I shall quote during my narration,
as I consider the whole story to be so
incredible that it requires the evidence of an
historian who, although not present himself at the
battle, was yet alive at that time and who both
knew and conversed with the survivors of the
invasion.</p>

<p>After the raid made by Dingaan on Port Natal,
in 1838, two Englishmen, named John Cane and
Robert Biggar, together with a few other British
adventurers smarting under the losses they had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
sustained, determined to retrieve them and avenge
their injured feeling by making a raid into Zululand,
for which purpose they mustered 18 Britishers,
5 or 6 Dutchmen, 30 Hottentots who were first-class,
up-to-date fighting men and less than 3000
Kafirs.</p>

<p>The number of fire-arms this motley outfit
possessed was 400 old-fashioned muskets, which
number included a few rifles and sporting guns of
that epoch, the great majority of the Kafirs carrying
only their shields and assegais, and this expeditionary
force they called the Grand Army of Natal.
Thus equipped, these daring Lost Legionaries
crossed the Tugela in February 1839, and entered
a mountainous broken country, where one of the
most bloodthirsty despots that Providence ever
allowed to exist awaited them, with an army of
over 50,000 highly trained warriors who had never
before been beaten.</p>

<p>Long odds, my gentle reader? Yes; too long odds
even for a bellicose Irishman wid his back teeth
awash wid the crater. Still, they did it, and now I
am going to quote Moodie.</p>

<p>Having crossed the Tugela River the advance
guard encountered some Zulu spies, and fired
upon them, thus opening the ball. Ascending the
opposite hill they came upon the kraal of &ldquo;Endonda
Kusuka&rdquo;&mdash;that is, tardy in starting&mdash;and surrounded
it before daylight. A detachment of Dingaan&rsquo;s
army was lying there, upon whom they opened
fire with their guns; when the inmates of the huts,
finding the firing directed low, took hold on the
tops of the huts, holding by the sticks which
formed the wattle-work. This plan was, however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
quickly detected, on account of the huts sinking
with the pressure, when the settlers directed their
fire higher up, and the people fell, wounded or
dead. The whole kraal was destroyed, the people
being killed and the huts burnt. As the morning
of this awful day dawned, many of those who
were attacked lying dead and others being in the
pangs of death, one of them said: &ldquo;You may do
with me as you please, and kill me; but you will
soon see and feel the great Elephant&rdquo;&mdash;meaning
Dingaan&rsquo;s army. The Elephant soon appeared,
and crushed them to death under his ponderous
feet. The land was very hilly, the hills stretching
out something like the fingers of a man&rsquo;s hand
when extended, rising to ridges in the centre, and
descending to deep ravines on each side; the kraal
being near the top of one of these ridges and
reaching down the slopes on each side. It was
at a short distance from this kraal that the great
Elephant presented himself and uttered his piercing
cry and terrific scream, which, coming from
thousands of infuriated savages, wrought to the
highest pitch of frenzy, must have had an appalling
effect, being enough to make the stoutest heart
quail.</p>

<p>Dingaan did not appear in person in this notable
battle, nor were the old warriors allowed to fight,
the young men being destined to win the highest
honours, and take the weapons of their foes as
trophies to perpetuate the memory of their
conquest.</p>

<p>The Zulu captains commanding were Umahlebe,
Zulu and Nongalazi. These, with the old warriors,
took their stand on the hill, from whence they could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
see all that passed, and issue their commands
accordingly. Seven Zulu regiments were brought
into the field of action. They were flushed with
three successive victories&mdash;first, the cutting-off of
Relief and his party at the great place; second, the
slaughter of the Boers in the Weenen district; and
third, the defeat of Uys and the dispersion of his
people. Besides they were full of rage at the loss
of their cattle, women and children at Utunjambeli,
and the destruction of the kraal before their eyes,
for which they were burning to be revenged.
These circumstances led them to fight with a fury
which could only be quenched in death. When
they were shot down, if they could crawl, they
would take an assegai and try to inflict a fatal stab
on one of their bitter foes, rendering it needful to
fire upon them again and again until dead.</p>

<p>The Natal army had therefore to fight with the
vigour of men whose lives were in a fearful
balance, and who were made desperate by the
greatness of the impending danger. They were
drawn up near the kraal in question, the English
and Hottentots with muskets in front, and the
native aids with assegais in the rear. The first
division of the Zulu army came on with a fearful
rush, but were met by the steady fire and deadly
shots of their foes, which cut them down like grass.
They were checked, broken, driven back and
defeated, many lying dead and dying at the feet
of the settlers. Robert Joyce, or, as he was called,
Bob Joyce, a deserter from the 72nd Regiment, had
ten men under him with guns, besides Kafirs; and
such fearful execution did they do that they cut
a pathway through the Zulu regiment as they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
approached, until the Zulu commanders ordered a
change in the mode of attack.</p>

<p>The first division, however, only retreated to
make way for the Zulu forces to come from
different points favoured by the formation of the
hill. Cane sent Ogle&rsquo;s Kafirs to attack the Zulus
on the south-west, whilst he, with the main body
of the Natal army, took the north-east. When
Ogle&rsquo;s Kafirs had dispersed these, they were to
come round and take the Zulus in the flank;
instead of which, the hour of revenge being come
for some affront which they received at Cane&rsquo;s
hands, when they had dispersed the Zulus they fled
to the drift, on which the Zulu chiefs exclaimed:
&ldquo;O ganti baka balegane&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;They can run,
can they?&rdquo; The sight of them running inspired
fresh courage into the Zulus, who now closed in
from all quarters upon the diminished Natal army,
coming down as an overwhelming flood, the mighty
masses of which it was impossible to resist. The
strife was deadly in the extreme. The Zulus lost
thousands of their people: they were cut down
until they formed banks over which those who
were advancing had to climb, as well as over the
wounded, crawling and stabbing, tenacious of life,
and selling it dearly.</p>

<p>Cane fought hard and died of his wounds. A
fine old Kafir who was present gave me a description
of his death. He was questioned about other
matters, but as soon as he came to this his eyes
appeared to flash with excitement and his hands
moved in all forms to express the firing of the guns
and the stabbing with the assegais. He took a
stick and held one point to his breast to show where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
the assegai entered Cane&rsquo;s chest. He then gave
his companion another stick, to show how a second
assegai was buried between Cane&rsquo;s shoulders,
Cane&rsquo;s gun was lying on his left arm, his pipe in
his mouth, his head nodding until he fell from his
horse and died. His horse was killed close by.
The last deed of this man was tragical. One of
his own people who had thrown away his badge
was coming to snatch the assegai from his back
when Cane, supposing him to be a Zulu, shot him
at once over his shoulder. Stubbs, another of the
Englishmen, was stabbed by a boy, and when he
felt it was his death wound exclaimed: &ldquo;Am I to
be killed by a boy like you?&rdquo; Biggar fell close
by. The Natal army being surrounded and cut
up, heaps of slain lay dead upon the field, to be
devoured by beasts of prey, their bones being left
to bleach under many summer suns. The work of
destruction was, however, not yet complete. No
sooner had the leaders fallen than the Natal Kafirs
threw away their badges and shields, and seized
the shields of the Zulus in order to favour their
escape, whilst the swiftness with which they could
run was their best defence. But in making their
escape the Zulus knew their ground, and that the
river must be crossed, and they therefore so surrounded
them as to compel them to take one only
course. In flight then these wretched beings had
no alternative but to take a path at the bottom of
which there is a descent of 100 feet perpendicular
to the river, having deep water at the bottom, and
so numerous were the bodies heaped upon each
other in this great grave that at length, instead of
leaping, they walked over the bodies of those who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
filled the chasm. One of those who made the leap
was Upepe, who was stabbed as he went under
water by a Zulu, who cursed him and said: &ldquo;I have
finished you&rdquo;; but the death wound was not given,
for the man escaped.</p>

<p>In order to complete the dire destruction of this
day of blood and death, a division of Zulus were
sent round to cut off those who might escape by
the river. These men were to be seen up to the
armpits in the stream, stabbing any who might be
in danger of escaping; and very few gained the
opposite bank and lived. It was here that another
leader, Blankenburg, was killed. Of the few who
escaped, some swam, some dived, and some floated
along, feigning to be dead. One Goba crossed the
river four times and was saved at last. Petrus
Roetrzie, or &ldquo;Piet Elias&rdquo; as better known by many,
entered the river lower than most of the others, and
got into the long reeds of the opposite bank, where
the Zulus searched for him in vain.</p>

<p>In this terrible battle fell John Cane, Robert
Biggar, John Stubbs, Thomas Carden, John
Russell,&mdash;Blankenburg, Richard Wood, William
Wood, Henry Batt, John Campbell,&mdash;Lovedale
and Thomas Campbell, with two or three other
white men, leaving not a dozen to return and tell
the tale of woe. Of the Hottentots three or four
returned; and of the Kafirs very few except Ogle&rsquo;s.
The few who escaped arrived at home singly, many
of them having been pursued nearly to the Bay of
Durban, owing their deliverance to the shelter of
the bush and the darkness of the night.</p>

<p>Most of the particulars herein recorded I can
vouch for as being correct, having conversed with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
several who were engaged in the transaction, and
others who were residing in Natal at the time.</p>

<p>Here endeth the extract that I have taken from
Moodie&rsquo;s aforementioned history.</p>

<p>Now, judging by the foregoing account of the
battle of the Tugela&mdash;which it must be remembered
has been extracted, word for word, from a history
written by a knowledgeable gentleman of undoubted
veracity, who not only knew the survivors of the
action, but had heard the yarn from their own lips,
and that the story told me by the old trader who
also had been acquainted with the majority of the
men composing the English army, he being a full-grown
boy at the time, and resident in Port Natal,
coincided and agreed with Mr Moodie&rsquo;s narrative
in all the principal details&mdash;I think I am not far
wrong when I assert that the battle of the Tugela
was a scrumptious one, in which every man engaged
must have enjoyed himself to the utmost of
his ability, and no one could subsequently grumble
at not getting his fair share of the fighting. Yet
when you come to consider the numbers and equipment
of that invading force, and compare them with
the resources at Lord Chelmsford&rsquo;s disposal when
he began to play the same game, just forty years
afterwards, and which were then declared to be
inadequate, you are forced to come to the conclusion
that Cane and his Lost Legionaries were a bit over-venturesome.
For looking back at my own experience
in the Legion, I do not think I could ever have
found twenty men daring enough to undertake the
same contract, and I am quite certain that, even had
the men been willing, I individually should never have
possessed sufficient pluck to have bossed the show.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>The story of Cane and his daring companions, unheard
of in England, is, I fear, being rapidly forgotten
in South Africa, but should any patriotic Natalian
with imperialistic convictions wish to perpetuate
the memory of those gallant adventurers, who, in
despite of Boers, savages, the devil, and the gasbags
of Downing Street, formed the advance guard
of the settlers in his lovely country, and see fit to
raise a subscription to build a cairn in commemoration
of the pluck, or call it foolhardiness&mdash;if you
like&mdash;of the first army of Natal, I, poor old sinner
as I am, will gladly plank down my mite. Yes, by
gad! I will, even if I have to forgo my baccy for
a month to raise the oof. For, by the great gun
of Athlone! those men were men, and died like
men, and may the British Empire never run short
of Lost Legionaries of like kidney!</p>

<p>And now, before the call of &ldquo;lights out&rdquo; is sounded,
let me relate briefly another deed of daring, performed
by one of the old-time Natal settlers, and
as I am not writing a history of Natal, but only
recounting a few well-authenticated facts of heroic
bravery, carried through by a handful of Lost
Legionaries, it will suffice to remind my reader that
Port Natal was occupied for the first time by
British regular troops in May 1842, when Captain
Smith (27th Regiment), with 200 men and two
field pieces, arrived there. He at once entrenched
himself on the flat ground near where the city
of Durban now stands, in which camp he was
speedily surrounded, and cooped up by an overwhelming
number of trek Boers. This rendered it
absolutely necessary for the beleaguered O.C. to
communicate with his superiors at the Cape, so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
as to warn them of his dangerous position, and
to request immediate reinforcements. But how to
communicate was the problem that required solving,
and it was solved, thanks to the devotion and undauntable
courage of one of the early settlers, who
promptly volunteered to carry the despatch.</p>

<p>Now despatch-carrying during war-time is by
no means a salutary occupation, even when the
distance is short, and the country over which it has
to be carried is open, with decent roads. What
then is the said duty to be called, when the bearer
has to traverse a distance of 600 miles, through
thick bush, dangerous swamps, rugged mountains,
and across innumerable rivers, very many of which
have to be negotiated by swimming. Also please
bear in mind that this delectable country through
which the orderly must travel swarmed with hostile
tribes, and was infested with wild animals, such as
lions, leopards, elephants, etc. Troth, I call such
a contract a decidedly unhealthy one. Yet such was
the nature of the road Richard King had to travel
alone, and bedad! he did it so successfully, for after
being ferried across the harbour with two horses,
on the night of the 25th May 1842, he slipped past
the Boer pickets, and overcoming all the difficulties,
and passing through all the manifold dangers met
with on the journey, he delivered his despatches
ten days after his start.</p>

<p>I regret exceedingly I am unable to recount the
details of that wonderful feat of skill, pluck and
endurance, although I was told them by one of
King&rsquo;s relatives, nor am I aware that the yarn has
ever been written; for I remember, having done
a bit of despatch-riding myself, how much I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
entranced by the narrative, and have always considered
Richard King&rsquo;s exploit to be a record
worthy to be treasured in the annals of the &ldquo;Legion
that never was listed,&rdquo; and I am sure that most of
my readers will allow I am right when I again
assert &ldquo;there were giants on the earth in those days.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<small>A QUEER CARD</small></h2>


<p>Yes, you are quite right in saying that there must
have been many queer as well as hard cases in
South Africa during the seventies and eighties of
the last century. Some of these I met, and knew
well, and if I had been asked, during that period,
to assign the biscuit to anyone of them in particular,
I should without hesitation have handed it to one
whom I shall call Mad Conway: a sobriquet he
had earned by his wild pranks and escapades.
As I said, this was not his name, but anyone
who resided either in Kimberley, Free State or
Transvaal, during those years, will at once recognise
who is hereby designated, or at all events
will do so when they have read a few lines further.
Now Mad Conway had also another nickname, as
he was likewise called, especially by the Boers,
Vrei Stadt Conway; the prefix having been earned
by his numerous deeds of reckless gallantry, performed
while fighting for the Free State against
the Basutos, during the war of 1865-1868. Yes;
Mad Conway was a caution, and in his own line of
business stood out unique. Let me describe him,
and recount a few incidents in his wild career.</p>

<p>To begin with, he was a cadet of a fine old
English county family, some of the members of
which were celebrated in the world of English
sport during the early part of the nineteenth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
century, and whose name, like that of Osbaldistone,
is still treasured by all true votaries of Diana.
Well, Conway in no way disgraced the family
reputation as a horseman, he being one of the very
best I have ever seen, and would, provided his lot
had been cast in the shires, have gained a place in
sporting song and story as well as his ancestors.
After having been sent home from Eton for some
mad escapade, he joined a crack cavalry corps, and
had to send in his papers, owing to his having
mistaken his colonel&rsquo;s pet charger for a horse
belonging to a newly joined cornet. Now this
charger was held as sacred in the corps as the
mares of Mahomet were held by the Moslems, but
Conway, after a heavy night in the mess, converted
it, with considerable artistic taste and skill, and a
couple of pots of paint, into a zebra.</p>

<p>On leaving the service&mdash;as he was over head and
ears in debt to the Jew sharks, who in those days
battened on the follies of young officers&mdash;troth! they
do it still, when not more lucratively employed in
the art of bogus company promoting, and other
congenial pursuits&mdash;his people thought a <i>tour du
monde</i> would be a salutary exercise for him, and
that if he could pick out some salubrious spot
about half-way round, and make a permanent camp
there, why, so much the better for them. So Mad
Conway landed in South Africa some time in the
fifties. Now what he originally intended to do
there I don&rsquo;t know, and I don&rsquo;t think he knew himself;
but he certainly wandered all over the country,
taking a hand wherever the chance occurred in any
Kafir fighting that might be going on, and putting
in his spare time big-game hunting and exploring.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>In both these congenial occupations he quickly
gained the reputation of being a man utterly devoid
of fear, while the wild and fantastic pranks he would
play when he happened to be in a town made him
an object of wonder and astonishment to both the
phlegmatic Boers and the lazy Portuguese, some
of them even causing his own more up-to-date and
reckless countrymen to open their eyes. During
this period of his existence he accompanied two
successive expeditions that were organised for the
purpose of searching the lower reaches and delta
of the Zambesi for a gold-laden dhow that the
Portuguese had sunk in the early part of the
century, so as to prevent her capture by an English
cruiser. On both these occasions Conway was the
only European who survived the attacks of fever
and wild beasts, and although, on the second trip,
they actually located the dhow, still, before they
could clear the drifted sand from off her his last
surviving mate died. Conway always declared
that, notwithstanding the awful hardships he had
undergone, he would have stuck to the job, lone
handed, and would have scooped the jack pot
himself, but the dop (common Boer-made peach-brandy)
cask gave out, and as that and quinine
were his sole diet, he had to chuck the contract
before he could touch the geldt. Darned bad luck,
he called it, especially as the long war waged by
the Zambesi natives against the Portuguese, at
that time breaking out, prevented him from having
another try for the plunder. Reaching Delagoa
Bay, thanks to the kindness of the officers of
one of H.M. cruisers, he wandered up to the
Transvaal, and took a turn on the early goldfields.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
Doing no good, he drifted away to the Free State,
where, as aforementioned, he earned the name of
Vrei Stadt Conway by his feats of reckless daring.
Let me recount one of them.</p>

<p>During one of the numerous unsuccessful
attacks made on the impregnable mountain Thaba
Bosigo, the principal stronghold of the great
Basuto chief Moshesh, a gallant Dutchman was
wounded and captured by the natives. This poor
chap, having been duly tortured, was crucified on
the very summit of the mountain. Moshesh at
once declared that the poor remains were to be
regarded as his standard, and at the same time
sent an insolent message to the Boers, stating the
fact, and challenging them to come and pull it
down. This brutal and contemptuous message
deeply enraged the Boers, and was all the more
galling as the poor fellow&rsquo;s remains hung in full
view of the Dutch laagers. Something must
be done at once; so the farmers&rsquo; war council
determined to recover the body, and called for
volunteers to do so. These being forthcoming,
the attempt was made, but the party, after fighting
its way about half the distance up the mountain,
having suffered heavy loss, halted. They caved
in, declared the undertaking to be impossible, and
point-blank refused to make any further effort.
This sensible determination, or pusillanimity&mdash;call
it which you like, but remember a Boer is no
coward&mdash;did not coincide with Conway&rsquo;s temperament,
he being one of the leaders. He had
declared he would bring that crucified corpse
down, or would bust in the attempt, and if his
men refused to come any further, why, he and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
his Hottentot arter-rider would go on alone; and,
faith! the two of them went. Troth, I forgot to
tell you before that his mother was Irish, and
when the best of English hunting blood is crossed
with the best of Irish fighting blood it is deuced
hard to stop the owner when on the warpath.
Well, subjected to a <i>feu d&rsquo;enfer</i>, these two beauties
scaled the almost perpendicular cliffs, and reached
the cross, which they pulled down, and removed
from it the battered remains. They then turned
to descend the mountain, only to find their one
path down it blocked by a strong party of the
enemy, who had allowed them to do so much, to
make sure of capturing them alive, and then the
following morning there would be three crosses
on the mountain instead of one.</p>

<p>This strategy on the part of the natives would
have caused most men to despair, and even the
bravest of the brave, if cornered in a like manner,
could have only hoped to enjoy a last good fight,
and sell his life as dearly as possible. Mad
Conway, however, thought otherwise. He had
declared he would bring the body down the
mountain or bust, and as the Basutos had blocked
the only path down which he could carry it, why
naturally he could only keep his word by throwing
it over the krantz, and then, by following it himself,
he would at all events balk the enemy of
their anticipated fun, and save himself from the
horrors of the torture stick. He and his faithful
Tottie boy, therefore, expended their remaining
cartridges, and then, bundling the corpse over the
edge of the precipice, jumped after it themselves.
No one looking at Thaba Bosego would believe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
the possibility of a man going over the edge of
its perpendicular krantzes ever reaching the
bottom with a semblance of humanity left, much
less that he could survive the awful fall without
every bone in his body being broken and life
crushed out of him. Yet Mad Conway and his
Tottie boy did so, and miraculously reached the
foot of the beetling precipice, not only alive, but
comparatively unhurt. Then picking up the corpse
they carried it, under a hail of bullets, back to the
schanze, where the rest of the party awaited them.
Now these men must have been blessed with charmed
lives, for although their scanty clothing was nearly
shot off their bodies they only received a few slight
flesh wounds, until they were just reaching the
safety zone, when Conway was knocked over with
a bullet through his left leg.</p>

<p>Well, now I have given you a glance at the
heroic side of this queer card, let me turn the tables
and spin you another yarn, so as to give you some
idea of the mad pranks he was capable of playing.
Here goes.</p>

<p>At one time, during the long protracted struggle
between the Free State farmers and the Basutos,
Conway was commandant of a small Dutch dorp
situated close to the border which, like all other
Free State villages, during war-time was laagered.
Now Conway&rsquo;s commando had in their possession
an ancient six-pounder ship&rsquo;s cannon so honeycombed
that, had they fired it off, the probability
is they would have made a considerable hash of
the gun&rsquo;s crew that served it. Still, it was a real
cannon that, when polished up and mounted on
a pair of waggon wheels, looked formidable. Well,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
mad Conway had this piece of antique ordnance in
charge, and being in his usual state of impecuniosity,
and the said cannon being the only available asset
he could lay his hand on, he one fine day determined
to raise the gentle breeze of affluence and
also to remove a possible danger to himself and
men by disposing of the ancient bombard to the
enemy, whose paramount chief, Moshesh, was most
anxious to obtain artillery at any price, be it ancient
or modern. This nefarious idea having been conceived,
he at once sent a message over the border
to Moshesh offering to sell it for 100 head of
prime cattle. Moshesh was delighted. All the
preliminaries were arranged: the time and place
for the transfer of old scrap iron for live stock
was fixed upon, and the transaction was carried
out, a small party of Basutos bringing 100 head
of splendid oxen across the border, which they
handed over, receiving the old carronade in return.
Mad Conway, many years afterwards, declared
to me that it was only when the cattle were safely
in his hands that the shameful wickedness of his
act struck him, and he realised that, no matter how
worthless the cannon might be, still he was an
officer in the service of the Free State, that he
had sold their war material to their enemy, and
that by doing so he had forfeited his last shred
of honour as an English gentleman. In fact his
conscience reminded him that he had placed himself
on the same low level as Mr Judas Iscariot,
so he at once turned-to, like the Hebrew traitor,
to purge himself of his shame. Now, my gentle
reader, don&rsquo;t, please, imagine that Conway handed
back the cattle, or expended a shilling in buying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
a rope wherewith to hang himself. No, not by
a jugful; for he differed in very many respects from
the Hebrew gent and when his qualms of conscience
became too poignant for him to bear he turned out
his commando, made a tremendous forced march,
overtook the gun escort, which he surprised and
routed, on their own side of the border, and
brought back the old thunderer in triumph.</p>

<p>Now some people may say that Conway had
been guilty of decided sharp practice over this
gun deal, but he always asserted that if old
Moshesh could not keep possession of a purchased
article after it had been delivered to him, and he
had taken it across the border into his own territory,
then he (Moshesh) was the only one to blame, and
that he had no cause to grumble. Anyhow, the
recapture of the gun reinstated Conway in his own
self-respect, and as the sale of the cattle brought him
in some &pound;500, I think you will agree with me that
he fared much better than the late Judas Iscariot,
Esq.</p>

<p>Through the unjustifiable interference of the
British Government, the long war between the Free
State farmers and the Basutos was brought to an
end in March 1868, so that Mad Conway must
needs look out for something else to do. He had
gained great kudos in the field, and the Free State
Government not only passed a vote of thanks to
him, but also determined to add a more substantial
token of appreciation, by presenting to him a large
farm, the title deeds of which were to be delivered
into his hands on the occasion of the last parade of
the Bloemfontein burghers, previous to their disbandment.
Well, the function was held, President<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
Brand made his speech, and at the end of it
Commander Conway&rsquo;s name was called. The hero
of the hour rode to the front, to be welcomed by
the plaudits of the men, and the handkerchief-waving
of the women. A fine figure of a man, and
a superb horseman, Mad Conway looked well as he
reined up beside the President, and one would have
thought that the bestowal of such an honour would
have made even the most reckless dare-devil in the
world conduct himself with decorum. Moreover,
Mr Brand was perhaps the one man in South
Africa who was highly respected, both by Briton
and Boer, and had frequently befriended Conway in
many ways. But alas! the Fates willed otherwise,
for the reckless child of impulse, prompted by Ate
or Old Nick, as usual, fell away and behaved in a
most shocking manner. I said prompted by either
Ate or Old Nick. Well, maybe they were the
original instigators, but they used deputies to
carry out their designs, for you see Conway had
that morning imbibed many klein soupjies, and
President Brand was wearing a tall bell-topper hat.
Of course you will understand in a moment that
a multifarious number of tots might excite a hot-tempered,
reckless fellow such as our friend, but it
may puzzle you why the hat of a respectable old
gentleman should arouse the somnolent devil in
Mad Conway. Let me explain.</p>

<p>A tall bell-topper hat was, at that time, and for
many years afterwards, an aggression that up-countrymen,
be they Boers or Britons, could not
stomach, for even in the latter eighties only two
men were allowed to wear them in Kimberley&mdash;one,
as old hands will remember, being Chief<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
Justice Buchanan, and the other Donald McKai,
the De Toits Pan market master. No one else, no
matter what his status might be, possessed the
temerity to appear in public wearing one; for, had
he done so, it would have suffered the same fate as
the presidential Golgotha did, on the occasion of
which I am writing. Yes, bedad! and it did suffer,
for Mad Conway had no sooner been given the
title deeds of the farm, and had uttered a few
words of thanks for the complimentary speech,
and the honorarium he had received, than he waved
his right arm wildly over his head and brought his
fist down flop on the presidential bell-topper, which
after emitting a drum-like thud, collapsed over the
ears of its portly wearer. Then there was the
deuce to pay and no pitch hot. Had anybody else
been in Conway&rsquo;s boots he would have been
massacred at once by the infuriated burghers, but
seeing it was Conway, and being accustomed to his
crazy vagaries, they sat on their horses and stared
open-mouthed at the extraordinary spectacle, while
the President attempted to struggle out of the ruins
of his battered <i>chapeau</i>. In a moment Conway
was himself again, was off his horse and assisting
the President in getting rid of his encumbrance, at
the same time pouring out a volume of excuses,
and censuring himself for his confounded clumsiness.
These excuses the dear old man accepted,
and, in fact, in a few moments was acting as comforter
to the brazen scallywag, so that the latter
emerged from what might have been a desperate
fix with honour and emolument.</p>

<p>Now let me tell you how I fell across this queer
character. I think it must have been about the end<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
of the year 1883 that I, who was at that time working
as a digger in Bullfontein, received an invitation
to dinner from an old brother officer residing at the
New Rush, for the purpose of meeting Mad Conway,
who had drifted down to the diamond fields
from the Transvaal. Of course, like everyone else
in South Africa at that time, I had heard heaps of
yarns about him, but although we had both served
in the same wars we had somehow or other never
met; so I joyously accepted the invitation. On my
arrival at my friend&rsquo;s house I was introduced to
this noted madcap, who turned out to be a well-dressed,
well-groomed, well-set-up man, who,
although past middle age, looked as hard as iron
and tough as whipcord. The dinner passed off
well, myself and others being kept in a roar of
laughter by the extraordinary yarns he related,
together with the inimitable pantomime with which
he illustrated them. Mad Conway had sojourned
on the diamond-fields in the earlier days, and had
literally been hunted from off them, his exodus
being so thoroughly in keeping with the man&rsquo;s
whole career that I think you will pardon me
should I digress and recount it. You see, it was in
this way. Conway was as usual over head and ears
in debt, and one fine morning he heard that writs
were out against him for civil imprisonment. This
was an indignity that sent him hopping mad, so
jumping on to his horse he galloped to the Court
House. <i>En route</i> he encountered the bum-bailiff,
who, mounted on an old pony, was looking for him,
and who was fool enough to try and stop him.
Waving a sheaf of blue papers in his hand, he called
on Conway to pull up, at the same time turning his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
nag athwart the road in an attempt to stop him.
It was only an attempt, for the next moment the
messenger of the Court and his gee-gee were heaped
up in the sluit, while his scattered documents were
being rapidly torn up by a mob of laughing, cheering
diggers. After his successful charge, Conway cantered
on to the Court House, through the sacred
portals of which he rode his excited and plunging
horse. Scattering the limbs of Satan and the grimy
scum usually to be found in such establishments to
the four winds of heaven. &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; shouted he to the
horrified magistrate. &ldquo;I heard you had been signing
some d&mdash;&mdash;d arrest papers against me, so I just
dropped in to tell you, you can shove them where
the monkey shoved the nuts. So long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop him! Arrest him!&rdquo; cried his outraged
worship, as Conway swung his horse round, and two
policemen made a half-hearted attempt to do so, but
were ridden over and dispersed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoop, gone away,&rdquo; yelled Conway, as he
emerged into the Free State road and burst
through a squad of mounted police. &ldquo;If you want
to catch me try to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They wanted to catch him very badly, and tried
very hard to do so, but the veld was close handy
and, Lord bless you! they might as well have tried
to rope a sunbeam as to round up Mad Conway once
he had gained the open plains; so that after he had
played with them until, I presume, he got thirsty,
he just turned his horse&rsquo;s head for the Free
State and cantered across the frontier, leaving his
baffled pursuers to ride their knocked-up horses
back to the disgruntled beak. This escapade
took place just before he joined the irregular<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
forces who were carrying on a desultory sort of
warfare with Sekukuni. It was while serving
with this disorganised crowd that Conway mated
with an ex-naval lieutenant as like himself in
character as two peas are in appearance. Faith,
they made a bonny half-section, for what one did
not know in the way of devilment, the other could
teach him. Well, it was just before the time when
the aforesaid irregular forces were to be reorganised.
Sir Garnet Wolseley was on his way up
country, so were strong reinforcements, and the
atmosphere was thick with shaves as to what was
going to happen. Now, it was just at this moment
this brace of beauties found themselves to be in a
dilemma: they were both stonybroke. True, they
were accustomed to be so, and as they had both
been appointed to irregular corps about to be
embodied, possessed smart uniforms and first-rate
horses, they thought it would be a hard matter if
they could not manage to raise a fortnight&rsquo;s board
and lodging of the best, together with the necessary
liquid, in liberal quantities, <i>bien entendu</i>, from somewhere
or other. Now half-a-day&rsquo;s ride from where
they were located was an up-country dorp, in
which was a canteen of such pretensions that the
owner, a leery old Scotsman, called it a hotel.
He was, like many of his countrymen, exceedingly
avaricious, and prided himself on his cuteness,
making a brag that no one could impose upon him.
For many years he had enjoyed the monopoly of
such trade as passed through the little township, but
latterly another individual had opened an opposition
shop, which, as it was slightly more up-to-date,
filled the old sinner with apprehension, and rage,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
especially as hard cash was very scarce in the
Transvaal at that date. Well, it was this close-fisted
old Boniface that our brace of worthies
determined to victimise, although to anyone else an
attempt to do so would have looked very hopeless
indeed. Now mad Conway was so well known in
the dorp, especially by the said Boniface, that it was
utterly useless for him to try to obtain credit for
a tot of dop, as the publican would sooner see
the liquor on his shelves than trust anyone for a
shilling. But at the same time he was well aware
that Conway had held, and was likely again to hold,
a fairly high position in military circles. The other
partner, however, was a perfect stranger. So this
was the way the two scamps worked the oracle.</p>

<p>One fine morning Conway cantered up to the
old Scotsman&rsquo;s hotel, into which he strode with a
bustling, dutified air. &ldquo;Swan,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;Colonel
---- (mentioning the well-known name of one of Sir
Garnet&rsquo;s principal staff officers) will be here in a
few minutes. He is riding in advance of the
General, so as to make arrangements for the
accommodation of Sir Garnet and his whole staff,
who will be staying in this dorp for some considerable
time. The Colonel was recommended to go
to the new hotel, but I, who am acting as his guide,
have persuaded him to try you first of all, to see if
you can furnish the necessary requirements. Of
course you will have to do your very best, furnish
the best rooms, supply the very best food and
liquor, and all that sort of thing, and the Colonel
will require a private sitting-room, in which to carry
on his correspondence, while he is awaiting the
General&rsquo;s arrival.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Old Swan nosed what he thought was going to
turn out to be a most profitable bit of business.
He had heard of the enormous sums of money
squandered by the Imperial Government during
the late Zulu war, and his fingers fairly itched at
the chance of being thrust into the plunder pot.
In a moment he was all smiles and attention, even
going so far as to promise to turn out, at a moment&rsquo;s
notice, all his usual guests and to reserve the whole
of the house for the great man and his staff.
Throwing open the door of his own cosy sitting-room,
he inquired if Conway thought that would
do until a better one could be provided, and also
asked if he should be doing right to invite the
Colonel to have a drink on his dismounting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Conway, &ldquo;I should hardly do that,
as perhaps Colonel &mdash;&mdash; may be one of those rabid
teetotallers who do not like to drink in public,
but you had better place a bottle of whisky, one of
brandy, yes, and perhaps one of gin, together with
some soda-water, and a box of your very best cigars
on that buffet, and if he should help himself you will
then know whether he drinks or not. Ah, by
Jove! here he comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A fine stalwart figure, clothed in undress uniform,
rode slowly across the big market square and,
reining up at the front door, leisurely dismounted.
Handing his horse over to the grinning Tottie
hostler, he coolly scanned the front of the premises
and the surroundings. Out rushed the obsequious
host, more leisurely followed by the debonair but
still respectful Conway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Conway,&rdquo; drawled the new-comer, &ldquo;so we
have arrived at last, and this is the hotel you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
recommended, is it? Well, perhaps it will do,
though I must confess I like the appearance of the
other one better. Still, I have no doubt our worthy
host here will do his best to make us all comfortable,
especially as our stay here may be rather a long
one. Let us step inside and see what accommodation
he has to offer, as you know how particular Sir
Garnet is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Enter the bandits, who are shown over the house
by the palpitating innkeeper, whose ears at the
illusion about the more attractive appearance of the
rival house are aching as if struck by an acute
pang of tic doloreux and he forthwith promises
at once to carry out the most frivolous suggestions,
and there were many of them, of the somewhat
haughty and exacting S.O.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now you have shown me the house,&rdquo;
quoth the latter, &ldquo;perhaps you will be good enough
to show me my private sitting-room, in which I
think, Conway, as I am somewhat fatigued by my
long ride, we might indulge in a biscuit, and on this
occasion, although I hardly ever take anything
stronger than tea, I think I will venture, Mr
Swan, on a glass of your best sherry or pontac;
and by the way, Mr Swan, at two o&rsquo;clock you will
be good enough to let us have the best and most
substantial lunch you can furnish at such a short
notice. Ah, this will do very nicely&rdquo;&mdash;as the deluded
innkeeper threw open the door of his own
snuggery and ushered his stonybroke guests inside.
The room looked like a cosy miniature bar, for the
the small buffet was loaded with bottles, plates of
delicately cut sandwiches, biscuits, and a big box
of extra-special prime cigars, while the canvas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
water-cooler was full of bottled ale and soda
water.</p>

<p>Well, our two adventurers were in clover, and so
well did they employ their opportunity that old
Swan, who had been bragging to all his usual bar
frequenters about having secured the General&rsquo;s
custom, and chuckling to himself over the huge
bill that, in the future, he would present, which
would be duly paid in bright English gold instead
of in worthless Transvaalian greenbacks, was
fairly wild with greed and pride. There was, however,
one small cloud on the horizon: the Colonel
had stated that he rarely touched anything stronger
than tea, and the tea-drinker is not nearly so
profitable a customer to an up-country innkeeper
as one who imbibes expensive drinks at short
intervals during the day. This gloomy conjecture
he confided to his circle of cronies, who condoned
with him, but the cloud, however, was to be quickly
blown away, for after he had summoned his guests
to their lunch he rushed back into the bar and exclaimed:
&ldquo;Tea-drinker, does he call himself? Tea-drinker,
ma certes! Why, they have finished the
sherry; they&rsquo;ve finished the pontac; they&rsquo;ve finished
the brandy and more than half finished the whisky,
and the Colonel has ordered two big bottles of
champagne for their tiffin. Yes, and I&rsquo;m blest if
they&rsquo;ve turned a single hair. Tea-drinker indeed!
My word, if the General and the remainder of the
staff drink tea like the Colonel, and are half as
drouthy, they will drink the dorp dry in less than
a week.&rdquo; And the old fellow rubbed his hands as
he booked the amount for the liquor consumed and
chortled over the anticipated profits.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, to cut a long story short, our two penniless
heroes lived for over a week on the very fat of the
land, their Gargantuan repasts and the amount of
liquor they consumed causing wonder and astonishment
in the quiet dorp. But the end of their bean-feast
was at hand. Sir Garnet, they knew, was in
the vicinity. Prudence warned them to absquatulate,
and they determined to cut their lucky, before
the inevitable <i>d&eacute;nouement</i>. One evening, therefore,
they informed old Swan that the expected
great man would arrive the next day, that they
were riding out in the morning to meet him, and
they conjured him to have things ready for his
reception. Next morning, with their wallets filled
with the best cigars, and their flasks full of the
best cognac, they rode gaily away on their quest,
and, bedad! it was high time for them to do so, as
they had not proceeded two miles out of the dorp
before they met the real Simon Pure, with all his
staff, escort and mule waggons <i>en route</i> to the
village they had just quitted. Well, they were
all right: the paymaster had arrived, all arrears
would be paid up, the war would start again, they
had had a high old time of it, and they lapsed into
roars of laughter when they thought of old Swan
and the fury he would be in when he found out
he had been hoaxed. Yes, old Swan&rsquo;s consternation
and rage were beyond description when the
General&rsquo;s cavalcade, instead of pulling up at his
highly decorated house, proceeded to that of his
hated rival, from whence, after a short interview
between Sir Garnet and the landrost, it continued
its way to parts unknown. Truly the old fellow&rsquo;s
provocation was great. Not only had he been put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
to much expense by the alterations to his house, but
the bill run up by the two marauders was a very
big one, and then the chaff that he would have to
submit to, because he, who fancied himself to be
more than cute, had allowed himself to be taken in
and done down by a well-known bad hat like Mad
Conway. No; it was not to be tolerated, so he
called for his horse and his two-shot scatter gun,
for the purpose of going in pursuit, but on second
thoughts that was far too risky a job, so he got
drunk, and goaded at last to desperation by his
wife&rsquo;s clacking tongue tried to beat her, but she,
being a strong-armed suffragette, took the contract
out of his hands and gave him the devil&rsquo;s own
thumping. So the poor old fellow subsided and
submitted to having his leg pulled with the best
grace he could muster. There was, however, a little
balm in store for him, as after the two freebooters
had had some financial dealings with the paymaster
they sent him a good round sum of money; for
they were both men who did not object to paying
their debts when they had the coin, and remembered
to do so. This remittance, although it brought
relief to his avarice, still did nothing to assuage his
injured self-respect. He had been taken in and
hoaxed. The yarn spread all over the country,
and he was unmercifully chaffed to the day of his
death about the way he had entertained Mad
Conway and the counterfeit Colonel. It was, however,
to be the last escapade of the latter, as the
poor fellow was shortly afterwards killed while
gallantly leading a desperate rush at Sekukuni&rsquo;s
Mountains.</p>

<p>I, however, had started telling you about my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
personal experiences with Mad Conway. Well,
after I met him at dinner, I saw a good deal of
him, and one day he asked me to come for a drive
with two of his friends, who owned a very smart
turn-out, to a well-known drift across the Vaal
River, where there was an hotel. We were to start
on a Saturday afternoon, stay there the night, and
return the next day. He promised me a lively
time, as two of the team of four horses were unbroken,
and the other two, although splendid
animals, possessed all the vices that gee-gees can
be either born with or acquire. The distance was
about twenty-five miles, the road was good, across
a dead-level flat, which, like most of those in
Grigualand West, was thickly sprinkled with ant-heaps,
from about a foot to two and a half feet
high. Well, perhaps the characters of the horses
and that of the two other men who were to accompany
us, both roaring blades, to say nothing
about the well-known recklessness of our Jehu,
might have made a nervous old gentleman give
pause and refuse the invite; but then you see at
that time I was not a nervous old party, and
although I have no wish to claim an inordinate
amount of pluck or recklessness still as I was blue
mouldy for the want of a bit of divarsion, and knew
Conway to be one of the best whips in Africa, I
gladly accepted. The start was a trifle exciting,
our two companions turning up just about half-seas
over, while the horses promised to act up to
their evil reputations. However, the trap was a
brand-new Cape cart, and the harness of the very
best, so that after some little circus play Conway
managed to get the nags to move off, and we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
started. The drive through the diggings was accomplished,
thanks to Conway&rsquo;s masterly management,
in safety, for although we scattered like chaff
many groups of niggers, we only upset two Parsee
pedlars and one Chinaman, the balance of the
damage done being the demolishment of a coolie&rsquo;s
habitation, which was constructed out of material
that at one time had been paraffin and sardine tins.
This accident caused the pious Hindoo who owned
the shattered tin-heap to swear horribly and spit
just like an angry cat; but I don&rsquo;t think we killed
anybody. When we reached the veld and were
on the broad, open waggon road, the horses, thanks
to the splendid handling of our charioteer, settled
down to a swinging pace. There was but little
chance of our meeting anyone, the scores of high-heaped
produce and wood waggons trekking into
Kimberley being, at that time of day, all drawn
off the road and outspanned, as were also the
empty waggons homeward bound, and I firmly
believe we should have reached our destination in
safety had it not been for the conduct of the other
two passengers. The drive was most exhilarating
as we rushed through the glorious air, and there
was plenty of excitement in it too for a man who
was not a glutton; for although the road was a
first-class one, and quite flat, yet frequently, when
we passed a group of outspanned waggons, the
Dutchmen&rsquo;s dogs would rush out and bark at us,
a proceeding that drove our unbroken and vicious
horses nearly mad. Yet I thoroughly enjoyed the
drive, and no doubt should have done so to the
end, as the change from the slogging hard work
of the mine, with its dust and dirt, was delightful,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
while the slashing pace we were going and the wild,
fresh, veld wind roused my animal spirits till I felt
as exhilarated as a penniless small boy does when he
is presented with an unexpected half-crown. But,
alas! we had other spirits on board, and our two
companions, who occupied the back seat in the cart,
partook of them freely, nor did they partake
of them in the orthodox manner, as the motion
of the swinging cart made the use of a glass
and a mixing of <i>aqua fortis</i> with <i>aqua fontis</i> a
somewhat difficult matter; so they dispensed with
the usual accessories and swigged the whisky neat
out of the bottle. Now this was a very dangerous
proceeding, especially as they had imbibed a fair
skinful previous to starting, and what with the
natural high spirits engendered by the drive, and
the other spirits they loaded up in the aforementioned
manner, they became very tight indeed,
and decidedly uproarious. First of all they began
to sing a song. That was a failure. Then they
began to chaff old Conway, which was dangerous;
and then they began to rattle and stamp their feet on
the floor of the cart, so as to make the horses more
restive, which was both unnecessary and foolish.
Conway, the muscles of whose arms were swollen to
nigh breaking-point, took no notice of their crazy
antics, except to order them to stop monkeying, as
it was all he could do to hold and guide the half-maddened
animals, but they paid no heed to his
admonitions. Then he cursed them with unction,
but that succeeded no better, till at last, thoroughly
angry, he shouted out: &ldquo;Oh, you want a smash,
do you? Well! by gad, you shall have one.&rdquo; And
without another word he bundled up the reins, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
he threw on to the leaders&rsquo; backs, at the same time
letting go a letter &ldquo;S&rdquo; cut with his whip which
impartially stung up every horse in the team, and
then sitting back he let go one of his well-known
wild bursts of laughter. At the moment this
happened we were about five miles from the drift.
The road was perfect, but some two miles or more
farther on there was a sharp bend in it, and the
problem to me was, would the maddened horses
keep to the road or take to the veld when they
came to it. I had not to wait long for the solution.
The horses, the moment they felt the whip, and
found their heads loose, at once broke into a
tearing gallop. Reaching the bend in next
door to no time, they took to the veld and tore
wildly across it, making straight for the long line
of willows that marked the river&rsquo;s bank. Here we
were bound to come a most unholy smash, provided
we ever reached it, but I knew there were far too
many ant-heaps on the way, and to run against any
one of these, which we were sure to do, would be
quite enough to upset our apple-cart. From the
moment Conway threw away the ribbons I knew
I must come an awful mucker, and had philosophically
prepared myself for the inevitable smash.
He simply leant back in his seat, giving vent to his
peculiar bursts of laughter, while the other two,
sobered up by the danger, howled curses, entreaties
and pious ejaculations in a duet that would have
been highly diverting under other circumstances.
Now events that are inevitable usually happen&mdash;at
least, that is my experience&mdash;and we had not
travelled far across the veld when the off-side wheel
of the cart struck an ant-heap, some two feet high,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
bang in the middle, when I immediately and involuntarily
vacated my seat. Yes; I left it in the
same manner as a war rocket should leave its
trough, and I described the same sort of a flight as
one of those infernal machines very often used
to do, for when I had described a parabola
through the air, and had reached the full height of
the trajectory, I turned a complete somersault.
Then my specific gravity bringing me back to mother
earth, I landed on my feet, ran a few yards so as
to ease off the momentum of my flight, and came
to a halt, devil a cent the worse. This was luck,
and I turned round to see what had become of my
companions, one or more of whom I feared must be
badly hurt. Conway was all right, that was evident,
as he was sitting on an ant-heap taking a pull at
a bottle of whisky that had somehow escaped the
debacle. Looking round, I saw the horses still
galloping, dragging the remains of the cart,
smashed to flinders, behind them. They disappeared
among the willows, and I could conjecture
the awful mess there must be at the foot of the
river&rsquo;s bank. I longed to go to their assistance,
for I dearly love a horse, but I first turned to our
two mates, for although they were, in my opinion,
far the worse brutes, still they were human brutes,
and fashion makes us serve them first. Going to
them as they lay amidst a debris of lamps, cushions,
karosses, etc., I saw one of them was not only
knocked silly but had broken his left arm and, by
the way he breathed and looked, I diagnosed concussion
of the brain. The other had broken his
left leg, had acquired a beautiful gravel rash all
over his face and was swearing at old Conway with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
much volubility. I was rendering the poor devils
first aid, and begging Conway to walk on to the
hotel to get more help, when we were hailed from
the road by a well-known Kimberley sawbones,
who, having providentially viewed the smash-up
from a cross-road, had borne down to our assistance.
A mob of Dutchmen and waggon boys were also
on their way from the hotel, so I was able to go
and look after the horses, borrowing a Boer&rsquo;s rifle
<i>en route</i>. On reaching the poor beasts I found
them lying in a tangled heap at the bottom of a
steep bank. The cart was smashed to matchwood,
and I had to shoot two of the nags, while the others
we extricated with great trouble, both of them
being badly hurt.</p>

<p>This was the finale of my first joy ride with Mad
Conway, and though I enjoyed many subsequent
ones, none of them were so exciting as the first.
I could yarn to you all night about this extraordinary
critter, and on some future date may give you
further reminiscences about him; but I think you
will allow, from what I have told you, that he was
a very queer card indeed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<small>A CONVERSION THAT FAILED</small></h2>


<p>It has always been a source of wonder to me why
so many people change their religion, for, although
I have never had the time, opportunity, or perhaps
the inclination, to study theology in any part of its
ramifications, and have never even read the Thirty-Nine
Articles which caused the fancy religionists
not only to desert their Church, but has now enabled
them, through their co-operation with rebels,
atheists, socialists and a gang of men who, so long
as they can hang on to power, are ready to play
any dishonourable game, to gratify their rancorous
spite in looting the said Church, my astonishment
still remains. Yet very many people of all classes
are frequently chucking up the faith of their fathers
and joining another. No doubt some of these
are actuated by sincere religious convictions, but I
think the majority of them are prompted by the
desire in some way to better themselves in this
life. For instance, to remove an obstacle that
prevents them from making an advantageous
marriage, to succeed to property, to advance themselves
in society or to make money. Still, there
are plenty of people who swap their fire insurance
policy for other motives, not even so respectable
as the few I have enumerated, and one sinner told
me that, having been a very bad hat during early
manhood, he had joined the R.C. Church as he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
had been assured that by doing so he had cleaned
his slate of the accumulation of his past sins and
had thereby choused Old Nick. This may or may
not have been the case, but anyhow he was very
ready to contract fresh obligations with the Old
Gentleman, as before we parted he managed to
swindle me out of a fiver; so that after mature
consideration I came to the conclusion that he
was not a brand that was likely to be snatched
from the burning, thanks to his change of religion,
but was still a very bad hat indeed.</p>

<p>Now anyone can understand, although he may
not admire, a man who, prompted by greed, love
or interest, changes his mode of worship. But the
man who I am going to yarn to you about was
not an individual of this class, and, moreover,
although he was most charitably disposed, and
always ready to plank down a cheque for any good
purpose, yet as a rule he did not pan out on religious
matters at all, and knew as much about dogma as
a chimpanzee does about snowballing. But let me
start the yarn from the beginning.</p>

<p>During the latter eighties, when I was adjutant
of the D.F.H., and was located at De Toits Pan,
there lived on the same diamond diggings a man
who carried on the trade of baker, and whom I
shall designate by his Boer name of Davy. Now
Davy had begun life as a ship&rsquo;s baker, and having
followed the sea for many years had drifted up to
the diamond fields in the early times, had started
in at his trade and had prospered exceedingly, so
that when I knew him he was a rich man, and
justly very popular with the diggers. In person
he was of medium height, thick-set, with great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
rounded shoulders, on which was stuck, for he had
not much neck to boast of, a huge round head that,
owing perhaps to the effects of early piety, was as
devoid of hair as a Little Englander is of patriotism.
As regards manners, he was rather brusque, and
until he came to know you was a bit repellent, and
was totally uneducated. But he was a white man
right through, and many a score of women and
children would have had to go hungry to roost,
during hard times, had good old Davy cut off
supplying bread, although the betting might be
decidedly against his ever pouching a single ticky
(threepenny piece) of their money. Now, this old
worthy, who as a rule never attended any Gospel
Mill, and was as devoid of theologic controversy
as one of his loaves of bread, nevertheless,
whenever he indulged in an occasional burst always
developed the idiosyncrasy that he must change
his religion, and would promptly set to work to do
so. What faith he had been brought up in originally
(if any) I know not, and I doubt if he knew
himself, but he tried all there were on the diamond
fields (and owing to the polyglot crowd located on
the diggings there were many), with the exception
of the Hebrew, from which ancient cult Davy
shied, as he always affirmed there was an obstacle
in the way, which required to be removed before
he could become a proselyte in the Synagogue.</p>

<p>Well, one fine day shortly after Davy had exhausted
the last available religion, De Toits Pan was
invaded by a commercial traveller in a brand-new
fancy faith, the name of which I forget, but it
was one freshly imported from America, and was
guaranteed to be something quite new, slick and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
up-to-date. In fact, its votaries might reckon on a
first-class ticket up to heaven, without any detention
at the custom-house, while, provided they subscribed
liberally, they might even expect to be
transmitted there in a private fiery balloon. Now I
never knew the ritual of the band of brothers, as they
called themselves, but I knew it was necessary
for a recruit, upon his initiation, to be soused over
head and ears in water, which was meant to
typify that all past sins would be washed away,
although I guess it would have taken more than
one ducking in cold water to have made an impression
on the case-hardened iniquities of some
of the converts who joined the movement. Yes,
by gad! it would have required scalding water, soft
soap, soda, and a wire scrubbing-brush to have
shifted their moral delinquencies. Still, if the
tubbing did not purify their immortal souls, it had
a salutary effect on their hides, so we can pass
that part of the performance as O.K.</p>

<p>Now, this missionary, spiritual bagman, or call
him what you like, was at the first go-off of his raid
very successful, doing a great business and roping
in very many proselytes, so many, in fact it made
the sky-pilots in the older established firms buck
up, and look askance. He laboured, however, under
one very great disadvantage&mdash;viz. there was no
building in De Toits Pan procurable, large enough
to contain the necessary water tank, so that until
one could be built the numerous recruits had to be
taken on the Sunday to the Modder River, and be
ducked therein. Well, just as the new movement
was in the hey-day of its popularity, good old Davy
went on one of his rare jamborees, and, <i>faute de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
mieux</i>, at once fell into line, signed on as a brother,
and on the following day (Sunday) went to the
Modder River with a number of other neophytes,
male and female, to undergo their preliminary
water cure. Now it chanced that, on the same
Sunday evening, I happened to be chatting in the
De Toits Pan club, when all of a sudden in dashed
Davy in a great state of perturbation. Rushing
up to the bar he demanded a double-headed whisky
straight, which he swallowed like an oyster, then
promptly held out his glass for another supply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Davy,&rdquo; quoth one of those present, &ldquo;you
seem to be gulping down the cratur with unction.
I thought you would have been nursing your new
religious doctrines at this time of night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Davy answered him not, but with a growl ordered
the barman to refill his glass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Davy, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; queried
another. &ldquo;What have they been doing to you to
capsize you in this fashion, and why don&rsquo;t you take
water with your pongello?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Water, indeed,&rdquo; snarled Davy. &ldquo;I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t want
no water for another month.&rdquo; And he made a
motion to the barman to pass the bottle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, ease up, Davy,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had
enough. Leave the whisky alone, and come over
here. Sit down and tell us how you got on this
afternoon at the washing f&ecirc;te.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoi,&rdquo; grumbled the old fellow, whom, it
seemed, the third nobbler had somewhat pacified,
as he took the offered chair and proceeded to light
his pipe, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get on at all, and this new-fangled
religion ain&rsquo;t worth a cuss. &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t one as
any man with any common-sense &rsquo;ud cotton to, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
as for the sky-pilot, he&rsquo;s jist as hignorant as a
howl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, tell us all about it. Did you imbibe
the faith?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faith, be d&mdash;&mdash;d!&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t imbibe
nothing except a gallon or two of Modder River
water.&rdquo; And he expectorated with disgust. However,
after he had been smoothed down a bit, and
had had another tot, he bucked up and related his
tribulations as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, boys,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I went down to the
Modder River this afternoon, with a large party of
other converts. The shepherd, as &rsquo;e calls his blooming
self, &rsquo;e comes along too, and brings two or three
of the sharps as &rsquo;elps &rsquo;im. Well, when we got there
we finds a couple of tents pitched: one for the
ladies, and one for us men, to take off our duds in.
Well, after a bit, one of the sharps, he comes to me,
and sez he: &lsquo;Brother, we&rsquo;s going to commence along
with you.&rsquo; So &rsquo;e shows me into the tent, and sez he:
&lsquo;Brother, remove your gaudy &rsquo;abiliments and put on
this &rsquo;ere garb of simplicity.&rsquo; And with that &rsquo;e &rsquo;ands
me a sort of a nightgown which came to about me
knees. As soon as I was togged out, feelin&rsquo; a bit
ashamed of meself rigged out like that, he leads me
down to the river bank and there was the shepherd,
as &rsquo;e calls hisself, long, thin, herring-gutted devil,
standing up to his middle in the water. &lsquo;Enter,
brother,&rsquo; he sings out to me, &lsquo;and &rsquo;ave your manifold
sins swabbed away.&rsquo; I wades in and whin I reaches
&rsquo;im the water took me up to the chin. He begins
his palaver, and before I knowed where I was &rsquo;e
puts his two hands on me shoulders and ducks me
bloomin &rsquo;ead under. He fair took me by surprise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
&rsquo;e did, or I&rsquo;d &rsquo;ave took an extra breath of air. As
it was, I lost me footin&rsquo;, and &rsquo;ad to struggle to come
up. Me old skull-cap comes off and I got me &rsquo;ead
above water, but no sooner did &rsquo;e see me old bald
pate appear than he shoved it down agin, and kep&rsquo;
on a-doing so until I was near drownded. Should
&rsquo;ave bin, I believe, &rsquo;ad I not managed to giv&rsquo; &rsquo;im a
punch in the bread-basket which shut &rsquo;im hup like
a pair of scissors, and then I scrambles out and
runs to the tent nigh water-logged. Presently
along &rsquo;e comes, and sez &rsquo;e to me, sez &rsquo;e: &lsquo;Brother,
wherefore did you assault me while in the water?&rsquo;
And I sez to &rsquo;im: &lsquo;You ain&rsquo;t no brother of mine.
What for did yer try to drown me?&rsquo; &lsquo;Brother,&rsquo; sez
&rsquo;e, &lsquo;I knew not you was so bald, and when yer &rsquo;ead
appeared above the surface of the river I laboured
under the delusion it was another portion of yer
hanatomy, and so as to prevent what might &rsquo;ave
become an indecent hexhibition I pressed it hunder
agin and continued to do so.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; sez I, &lsquo;yer
religion may be a darned foine one, and yer may
be a darned foine shepherd, but whin yer don&rsquo;t know
the difference between a conwert&rsquo;s bows and &rsquo;is starnpost
&rsquo;tain&rsquo;t no religion for me, and I &rsquo;ud scorn to
belong to it or own yer as a brother or shepherd,
so ye and yer &rsquo;ole gang can go to h&mdash;&mdash;.&rsquo; And
with that I left &rsquo;im and came &rsquo;ome as fast as I
could git.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now although I think that on this one occasion
old Davy&rsquo;s plea, like himself, was a good un, and
that he, under the aforementioned circumstances,
was fully justified in doubting the <i>bona fides</i> of this
fancy religion through the lack of acumen and also
the gross ignorance on the part of the shepherd, still,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
as one swallow does not make a summer, this one
legitimate case of perversion does not, in my eyes,
justify the large number of people who chop or
change their faith and are always thronging to hear
some half-crazy tub-thumper, be he a long-haired,
red-nosed revivalist, unctuous Mormon or any
other hypocritical expounder of a new cult.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>JACK ASHORE IN 1871</small></h2>


<p>Yes, I&rsquo;ve had the honour and pleasure of serving
in the same outfit as H.M. bluejackets, and I will
maintain that the British sailor is second to none
either as a fighting man or love-maker, the only
man, in my unbiassed opinion, to equal him in the
above pursuits being the Irish soldier. Now Jack
and Pat both keenly appreciate a bit of fun and
devilment, but I think, in pursuit of divarsion, Jack
must be assigned the cake, as during his hours of
relaxation, while at liberty, on shore, he frequently
displays a bit of originality in his pranks that, in
fairness I must confess, land him ahead of my dear,
reckless, light-hearted countrymen. During the
New Zealand wars the Maoris called the Naval
Brigade Te Ngati Jacks, and they insisted that
they belonged to a different people from the remainder
of H.M. forces; for you never could convince
the old-time Maori warrior that the loose-clad,
rollicking, gallant sailor was of the same blood
as the tight-buttoned-up, stiff and more stolid,
though equally brave, soldier. This erroneous idea
was, I think, also in a great measure due to the fantastic
capers Jack cut while enjoying his well-earned
liberty on shore, during which treasured moments
he strove to cram into twenty-four hours all the
fun, and also as many of the minor vices, as he could
manage to indulge in, and I am only doing him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
justice when I state he usually succeeded in participating
in as much devilment during those few hours
as would satisfy an ordinary healthy Tommy for
a year.</p>

<p>Times, customs and manners have greatly
altered since 1870, and although there can be no
doubt that, changed as in many respects our fleet
men are from the sailors of the past generation,
still the same courage and devotion exists in our
present-day, highly trained, splendid naval seamen
as ever instigated the grand old hearts of oak, who
boxed yards about, pulled on bits of string called
halyards, braces, etc.; and, totally ignorant of electricity,
cursed steam. Moreover, there has been
a great change for the better in the conduct and
sobriety of our ever-popular and much-loved bluejackets
when ashore on short leave.</p>

<p>Settlers, old identities, in colonial seaport towns,
will, I am sure, endorse what I have written above,
for although during the forty years I lived in the
colonies I never heard of one of H.M. bluejackets
committing a crime, still some of their sprees
were rather alarming to nervous people, while they
shocked the puritanical, hypocritical humbugs, of
whom there is always a superfluity wherever the
Union Jack flies. For these cattle, being able to
indulge in their pet vices <i>sub rosa</i>, or else being
too narrowminded to make allowance for the
festive pranks of high-spirited men, let loose for a
few short hours after being cooped up on board
ship for months at a stretch, where they have been
subjected to the most severe discipline in the world,
hold up hands in horror at poor Jack&rsquo;s frolics, and
call the brave fellow, whose mess tins they are not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
worthy to swab out, a drunken, profligate sailor-man,
unfit to be at large in this world, and sure to
be damned in the next. Yet many of Jack&rsquo;s sprees
were most diverting to the looker-on, as he would
frequently introduce into his frolics some originality
that, simple in itself, and most probably quite unpremeditated,
still compelled anyone with the
smallest spark of humour in his composition to
thoroughly appreciate. I am now going to spin
you a yarn about one bluejacket&rsquo;s spree that, if it
does not amuse you, at all events afforded myself
and some of my comrades, just down from the
frontier, a hearty laugh. The scene was Wellington,
New Zealand, the date somewhere about the
end of 1871, when, the long war having burnt itself
out, and the sharp fighting having smouldered itself
away to the ordinary frontier defence work, myself
and a few of my comrades had, for the first time
for nearly six years, the chance of returning for a
period to civilisation and enjoying such comforts
and luxuries as were at that time to be obtained in
the capital of New Zealand. This we were doing
with a relish only to be enjoyed by men who have
for years been living, or rather enduring, a hard
bush life, utterly debarred from the ordinary
pleasures of society, and the refinement of ladies&rsquo;
companionship.</p>

<p>We were doing ourselves well, and going very
strong, when the fun was enhanced by the arrival
of a squadron of H.M. ships, with whose officers we
fraternised, notwithstanding the fact that they ran
us very close, if they did not quite cut us out, in the
favour of the fair New Zealand ladies, for both
officers and men of H.M. Royal Navy are as hard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
to contend against in the rosy lists of love as they
are to beat in the ruddy game of war. No matter
if there may have been a trifle of jealousy between
us in those days it did not matter a row of pins,
and we all enjoyed rattling good times. But hold
hard, I am off the trail of my yarn, and so must
try back. Well, the squadron anchored, squared
yards, and, after the ships had been put into apple-pie
order, in due course of time, leave was given
to the crews, and the starboard watches came
ashore to enjoy themselves for twenty-four hours.
This they did; and my word they made the town
of Wellington lively, opening the eyes and elevating
the hands of the unco guid in a way that, to such
lost sinners as ourselves, was most exhilarating.
In those days, I know not if such be the case now,
every sailor had the fixed conviction that he was
a perfect master of equitation, and no sooner did
he get ashore than he yearned to ride a horse, or,
failing to obtain one, a mule, a donkey, a cow or
even a goat came not amiss. Some four-footed beast
must be obtained by hook or by crook, or, if saddle
animals were quite unobtainable, then he must
drive or be driven. Well, the starbowlins came
ashore and painted the town a vivid red, and the
streets soon became full of bluejackets, mounted
on every description of animal, some of the poor
beasts having to carry double, while now and again
you would see some cart-horse, very long in the
back, ridden by three laughing, shouting sailors, the
whole of the cavalcades galloping and sidling up
and down the main roads cheered to the echo by
their admiring messmates, while the riders, with
their bell-bottomed slacks rucked up above the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
knees, their elbows square with their ears, and a
rein, or as Jack termed it a yoke-line, in either
hand, held on like grim death to a dead nigger.
Yet numerous were the falls and collisions that took
place, and it appeared to be fully understood that,
should a rider be pipped, his loose horse and empty
saddle should be the lawful prize of the lucky shipmate
who first captured them, and sometimes you
could see half-a-dozen or more Jacks trying to
board the said prize from both sides and ends of
the unfortunate quadruped at one and the same time.
Many of the horses could and did buck a bit, but
this did not seem to daunt Jack one iota; in fact,
buck-jumping appeared to rather enhance the value
of the mount, and I saw some wonderful and
determined attempts to stick on viciously bucking
animals, the rider hanging on manfully by gullet
plate and cantle, yea, you might say with teeth
and toe-nails, yelling, &ldquo;Whoa, whoa, you&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;
at the top of his gamut, while his admiring comrades
howled their applause, every man-jack of them
anxious to try his luck the moment the temporary
horseman should be grassed. Of course it must
be remembered that all of these men had been
accustomed to jockey the yard-arm of a plunging
ship, and as Jack is by nature and training utterly
fearless, I should have bet my bottom dollar that
any one of them would have unhesitatingly tried to
have ridden Old Nick himself, had he chanced to
have come along on four legs. Here I&rsquo;m off the
right spoor of my yarn again, so must circle and
pick it up.</p>

<p>It was on the afternoon of the said day, a number
of us were gathered together in the billiard-room<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
of the club, when a tremendous cheer from the
crowded street caused us to make for the verandah,
to see what had caused such an uproar. And this
is what we spotted. But mark time, as I must
digress again for a moment.</p>

<p>Years before Cobb &amp; Co. introduced into New
Zealand their American coaches some speculative
settler had imported one of the original London omnibuses,
a vehicle of great length, on which the top
passengers sat back to back, with their knees up to
their chins on what was known as knife-boards, and
gained these perches by crawling up perpendicular
iron ladders fastened to either side of the door. A
more unsuitable trap could not have been invented
for New Zealand roads, so that shortly after its
arrival it was stowed away and forgotten by the
general public. Its owner, however, was a cute
fellow, for hearing of the probable invasion of sailors,
he had the old ramshackle caravan made roadworthy,
horsed it, and, on the landing of Jack, promptly
chartered it to a large party of them, so that it was
the sudden appearance of this prehistoric tramcar,
rumbling along the street, that had evoked the
burst of applause which had attracted our attention.</p>

<p>Truly Jack had rigged and fitted out the old
shandrydan handsomely, as flags, streamers and
wreaths decorated it wherever it was possible to
make them fast. Nor was she indifferently manned,
as even musicians had been provided, for, perched
along the driver&rsquo;s footboard, two more than half
drunk fiddlers and a half-section of equally intoxicated
fifers sawed and blew for all they were
worth. The coachman sat on the usual raised seat
in the centre of the fore cross-bench, and on either<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
side of him lolled two huge quartermasters who,
cigar in mouth and arms crossed, tried to appear
quite at their ease and preterhumanly sober. The
roof of the vehicle was overcrowded with brawny
bluejackets all rollicking drunk, who demonstrated
their good will to the passers-by and the laughing
spectators in the windows by holding out to them
bottles of liquor, while at the same time they
exchanged badinage of a saline nature with their
messmates thronging the side-walks. The inside
of the old omnibus was occupied by only two men,
who ostentatiously sniffed at and frequently tasted
huge bottles of make-believe medicine, while at
intervals they exhibited to the onlookers grotesque
imitations of surgical instruments, and, in case it
required any further explanation as to what the
interior of the vehicle was intended to represent,
over the windows and doors were chalked such
notices as&mdash;Sick-bay, Dead-house, Boozers-locker,
etc. All this was funny enough, but although the
appearance of the old rattle-trap somewhat surprised
us, still there was nothing, after all, extraordinary
in its existence, nor in its festive crew, and
we should merely have laughed and forgotten the
circumstance had we not spotted, the moment it
came abreast of us, a wondrous appendage to the
vehicle itself, for at the tail-end over the door
protruded two stout poles, from which was suspended
a large-sized stable wheelbarrow. Now what in
the name of Comus could Jack want with a wheelbarrow?
Its presence roused our curiosity, so that
we at once made for the stables, where our horses
were carefully locked up, mounted and followed the
festive show that had taken the road towards the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
Hut (a small village a short distance along the sea
coast from Wellington and a very pretty drive).
Our journey in search of knowledge was not to
take us far, for we had only just caught up to the
slowly moving caravan when, as it turned a sharp
corner, one of the crew, rather more drunk than the
others, lost his balance, tumbled off the top and
landed on the road, which fortunately for him was
at this spot heavy sand, with a concussion that
would have killed or seriously maimed any sober
landlubber. In a moment a shout of &ldquo;Man overboard&rdquo;
was raised and a stentorian voice howled
out: &ldquo;Hard down with your helm, back the main
yard, heave to,&rdquo; and in almost the same breath:
&ldquo;Pipe away the jolly-boat.&rdquo; Out rang a shrill
pipe: &ldquo;Jolly-boats away,&rdquo; and in a second down
was lowered the wheelbarrow, down slid two men,
and before even a woman could get breath for a
squeal, or any of the horrified spectators could
gather round the unfortunate, who lay on the
road striking out with his arms and legs as if
swimming, they ran the wheelbarrow up to him,
dumped him in, ran him back to the door of
the sick-bay, into which he was promptly hauled
and administered to by the attendants. &ldquo;Hook on
and hoist jolly-boat&rdquo; was the next order, the crew
of which, disdaining the use of ladders, scrambled
up the side, and the wheelbarrow was run up and
made fast. Then came the order, &ldquo;Square away
the main yard,&rdquo; the coachman whipped up his horses
and away they went before the gaping populace
could remember or make use of a single pious
ejaculation. Now this was very funny, and we all
enjoyed a hearty laugh, but Jack was far from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
end of his farcical frolic, as there was, not far ahead,
a house, half inn, half farm, owned by a fine, bluff
old sea-dog who had himself served as bos&rsquo;n in
the Royal Navy, and as they were sure to halt&mdash;I
beg pardon, heave to&mdash;there, thither, expecting
more fun, we determined to follow them, and were
not sorry we did so, as no sooner were they abreast
of the house, which was situated a few feet from
the roadway, than H.M.S. <i>Shandrydan</i> was again
skilfully hove to, the jolly-boat was lowered and
manned, and the strident voice sang out: &ldquo;Pipe
all hands ashore to lay in wood and water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then as a combined movement took place to
vacate the roof: &ldquo;Vast heaving, you thirsty swabs;
see the sick-bay cleared first, the fiddlers and idlers,
and then the rest of you take your blooming turn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The order was carried out to the letter, each
man as he got into the barrow being run up to and
shot out on to the verandah, every one of them on
recovering his feet touching his cap to the host,
who stood beside the open door, and saluting him
with the words: &ldquo;Come on board, sir.&rdquo; We had
seen enough, so cantered gaily back to the club,
myself thinking how extremely useful the jolly-boat
would be later on, always provided the crew of
it were teetotallers, in assisting their messmates
to their quarters when H.M.S. <i>Shandrydan</i> had
finished her cruise and her gallant crew&rsquo;s back
teeth were awash with their potations. Yes, the
idea of carting along the wheelbarrow was not only
humorous but it demonstrated profound forethought
on the part of the Jacks, and I maintain
that no soldier in the world, not even my beloved
countrymen, would ever have the nous to devise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
such a whimsical, and at the same time provident,
entertainment, so I therefore declare that her
late Majesty&rsquo;s bluejackets were the first in devilment
as they ran the Irish Tommy neck and neck
in war. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s good luck to the crowd of them!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<small>THE CONVERSION OF MIKE O&rsquo;LEARY</small></h2>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;Whin a man&rsquo;s that cross and crabbed that his sowle&rsquo;s as black as paint,<br />
An&rsquo; his contrary conversation wud petrify a saint,<br />
And he will ate mate on fast days, an scornes the praste as well,<br />
Ould Nick will soon be after him, to escort him straight to (the guard room).&rdquo;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 30em;"><span class="smcap">Quin.</span></span>
</p>


<p>Years ago I was soldiering in South Africa, and
at that time owned a few horses, my own private
property and nothing to do with the Government.
I used to race a bit in a small way, just for the
sport, and it became necessary for me to employ
a groom who must be my own private servant.</p>

<p>Now grooms were hard to get, especially at the
price I could afford to pay, and I did not want a
man of the sundowner stamp. One evening my
servant came to me and informed me that a man
had come into camp who was looking out for a
job and he thought he would do. On my asking
him why he thought he would do (for Quin, though
an Irishman, was, wonderful to relate, no horseman
and had no knowledge of horses) replied: &ldquo;The
man is an Irishman, a small man, a knowledgeable
man, and also a townie of my own.&rdquo; So I
decided to see him, and Mike O&rsquo;Leary was ushered
in. Directly I saw him I seemed to know him, but
for a time could not place him, till at last it flashed
through my mind he must be Charles Lever&rsquo;s
Corney Delaney come to life again, or at all events<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
the creature in front of me must be a descendant
of his. Not that the dress was similar, for my man
wore breeches and boots, both of which wanted
renewing, but the head, the face, the cross, crabbed
expression and the general appearance were exactly
like the immortal Corney as depicted by Phiz in
&ldquo;Jack Hinton.&rdquo; He was a tough, wiry little fellow,
showing, as we say out in the colonies, the marks
of the Whalaby.</p>

<p>He stood rigidly to attention, after glancing at myself
and belongings with a sneering grin that would
have excited the envy of Satan himself. So I opened
fire with the remark: &ldquo;You are an old soldier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; quoth he; &ldquo;and served in the 57th, God
bless them! They wor a rigimint you could be
proud of, not a tearing lot of divils the likes of
what you&rsquo;ve got here. Bad scran to them! it&rsquo;s
neither soldiers or peelers they be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;leave the men alone. I
want a groom. Are you one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lot of grooms you do be wanting, judging
by the look of your troop horses,&rdquo; he snarled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave the troop horses alone. I want a man
as my own private servant. Do you want work of
that sort?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may take you on trial,&rdquo; he rejoined, &ldquo;for
did I not serve under your honourable father, Sir
George Brown, in the Crimee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Sir George Brown was not my father, nor
any relation to me, but Mike O&rsquo;Leary would have
it so, and Sir George was trotted out of his grave
and thrown in my teeth as long as Mike lived. Well,
he was not a promising lot, but I was so hard up
for a man, and the horses wanted so much looking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
after, that I took him on. As a groom he was
perfect; never have I seen a man his equal. The
horses took to him, and he was devoted to them.
But, by the Lord Harry! he was a blister to everyone
else on the station. How he had ever been
enlisted in the 57th the Lord only knows, and how
he had ever existed in the regiment is a mystery
to me to this day. His tongue was as sharp as a
double-edged sword, and as bitter as gall, but the
little fiend could fight like a gamecock, and was as
hard as iron, so that when his remarks were resented
he was always ready to back his words up with his
hands, until at last most of the troopers were only
too glad to leave Mike alone.</p>

<p>As regards myself, he showed me neither
deference nor respect, would never say Sir when addressing
me, and would openly and audibly criticise
my riding, my personal appearance, my drill, and
my dress, and none of these to my credit. Poor Sir
George was also brought to the fore every day, and
the difference between us as to morals, manners,
sport, or anything else that might be on the tapis, was
pointed out and expatiated upon, and never in my
favour. The little beast became quite obnoxious to
me, but he did so well by the horses that I could not
part with him, and came at last to look on him as a
trial sent by Providence to humiliate me, and as a
punishment for my sins; so I was bound to accept
him as such, and put up with him.</p>

<p>Well, things went on like this till one day, when I
came in from a long patrol, I found Quin on the sick
list and that Mike O&rsquo;Leary had installed himself
in his place as servant. Now if I had wanted him
to come and look after me, nothing on earth would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
have made him come, but as he knew he was the
last man on the station whose presence I desired
in my rooms, of course there he was and there he
evidently intended to stick. In vain I told him
he would be overworked looking after both myself
and the horses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, and don&rsquo;t I know that?&rdquo; he snarled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
little thanks I&rsquo;ll get from the likes of you, who
spends your money on debauchery and blaggardism,
and pays your servants, who works their fingers
to the bone, as little as ye can; but I knows my
duty to your honourable father, God rest his sowle,
and while that useless baste Quin is skulking, I&rsquo;ll be
here to see you to bed when you come home drunk
every night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What was to be done? I though matters over,
and at last determined to attack Mike on his only
weak spot. Mike I knew to be a rigid R.C., but he
was also saturated with superstitions. He had all
those of the usual Irish peasant, and a good many
more of his own.</p>

<p>He firmly believed in witches, ghosts and fairies,
good and bad, and was convinced that the devil
himself was frequently knocking around looking
for someone to transport to tropical regions.</p>

<p>As to his religion, Mike was very devout, with one
exception&mdash;he would eat meat on Fridays. &ldquo;Fast, is
it?&rdquo; he would say. &ldquo;A soldier may ate his rations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you are not a soldier now, Mike.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, and whose fault is that now? Did not I
put my pride in my pocket and offer to join your
blackguards, and did not that T.S.M. tell me I
was too small? Bad luck to the lout! Was I not
fighting in the Crimee with your honourable father<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
before he was breeched? It&rsquo;s little the likes of
him is fit to be T.S.M., but what can you expect
when the captain ought to be at skule learning
manners! It&rsquo;s little of an officer you&rsquo;ll ever make.&rdquo;
Exit Mike, with a well-directed boot after him.</p>

<p>It was an uphill job, but I worked and worked
away at him. I even persuaded the good Father
de Rohan to go for him and preach abstinence
to him, and even threaten him with pains and
penalties if he did not put the muzzle on. But
no good. Then I began to pretend that the rooms
were haunted, and that rather fetched him, but
yet, though he was uncomfortable, it did not quite
hit the right spot.</p>

<p>At last Fortune played into my hands. A
lieutenant who had been away on long leave rejoined
and was sent up to my station. He was a
very tall, thin man, very dark, with straight features,
large eyebrows and moustache, and Mike had never
seen him before. The first night he joined we
were talking over our pipes, after dinner, when he
mentioned a very swell fancy-dress ball he had
been to. At once I asked him in what character
he had gone. Of course he replied: &ldquo;Mephistopheles.&rdquo;
Had he brought his dress out with
him? Yes, he had it in his kit. Would he do
me a very great favour? Why, certainly. Then I
told him about my incubus, Mike, and I earnestly
requested him to put his dress on the next night
and play the devil for Mike&rsquo;s benefit. Of course
he was only too delighted to assist, and the plot
was duly laid.</p>

<p>That night I went to my quarters. There was
Mike, with his usual pleasant remarks and sneer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">THE DIVIL, BEDAD!</span>
</div>

<p>I stopped short and said sternly: &ldquo;You have
been smoking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Begorra I&rsquo;ve not,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you have been lighting those beastly
sulphur matches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>I walked over to the dressing-table, looked in
the glass, then started back, and let out at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have done with your fooling tricks. How
dare you grin over my shoulder like that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it was not you it must have been the devil
then,&rdquo; I said sternly. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t wonder at it,
when such a cross-grained ugly beggar as you
sits in my quarters alone at this time of night.
Take care, Mike,&rdquo; I said impressively; &ldquo;take
care. Remember what Father de Rohan told you.
If you will eat meat on Friday, and will quarrel
and insult everyone, the devil will be after you
in earnest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; I cried, looking hard past him.
&ldquo;Get out of this, Mike; the company you keep
here when I&rsquo;m out is not safe for a Christian
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned very white, was evidently very uncomfortable,
crossed himself over and over again,
and bolted.</p>

<p>Next morning he brought two sticks, when he
came to my room, which he crossed on the fire
hearth, and when he turned up at night-time he
had evidently been to the canteen, for he was pot-valiant
and I could see he had a bottle with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you will be afraid to stay in the
rooms alone,&rdquo; I said, as I left for dinner.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not,&rdquo; said he; but I saw the blue funk
rising in him. It was a Friday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you eat meat to-day?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did that,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and I will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, God help you,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s great
danger you are in this night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was midnight when the lieutenant, fully got
up in a most perfect fancy dress, and looking his
part to perfection, appeared in the mess hut. In
his hand he carried a few inches of time fuse, and
also a huge fork, known in the service as the
tormentor. The cook uses it to take the men&rsquo;s
meat out of the boilers. We all crept up to my
quarters, which consisted of a hut with two rooms
in it, in the front one of which was the victim. To
light the fuse and pass it under the door was the
work of a moment, then to open the latter and step
in took no longer. Mike, who had been absorbing
courage from the bottle, had fallen asleep, but was
waked up by a prod from the tormentor. He woke
with a growl of rage, that changed into a yell of consternation,
when he saw the terrific figure regarding
him through the sulphury smoke of the fuse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mike O&rsquo;Leary,&rdquo; said a deep voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come
for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Mike, who had fallen back open-mouthed,
with the sweat of fear trickling off him, whimpered:
&ldquo;Oh no, good Mr Devil; wait for the master.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; thundered the voice; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s you I want, not
your good, kind master, who&rsquo;s been a friend to you,
and who you sneer at, insult and deride, and who,
Protestant as he is, tries to stop your greedy sin of
eating meat on fast days. Come on!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he made a pass at Mike with the tormentor,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
which Mike dodged by going over backwards, chair
and all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never cheek him again, by this, and by
that, I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; yelled Mike, as he got another
prod in a fleshy part, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll never touch meat
again, I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; But at that he fainted. He soon
came round, and was on his knees telling his beads
when we entered the room, as if we were going to
have a parting smoke before turning in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the deuce have you been up to, Mike?&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;Who has been here? What is the cause
of this awful smell, and what have you been making
such a row about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O holy Mary! sor,&rdquo; whined Mike; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s been
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who the devil has been here, you drunken
blackguard?&rdquo; I shouted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear sor, oh, kind sor, don&rsquo;t spake disrespectfully
of the Ould Gentleman; shure he&rsquo;s been
here, and has just left. Oh, sor; I&rsquo;ll repent, I will.
For God&rsquo;s sake send for the holy father. What
will I do? What will I do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>We got him to his quarters at last, and next
morning Mike was a changed man. Although still
by nature cross-grained, yet a more respectful
servant or a better comrade could not be found on
a month&rsquo;s trek, and he stayed with me till he died,
two years afterwards, regretted by everyone who
knew him. <i>R.I.P.</i></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>BUSHED</small></h2>


<p>In very many parts of the world, which on the
map are painted red and collectively called the
British Empire, there are huge tracts of country
covered with forests of all sorts, which are known
to the inhabitants of the different colonies by
various names, and these have exacted a heavy
toll of human life from the venturesome traveller,
prospector, hunter, or others, who have entered
their recesses on their own business or pleasure.
If the scrub of Australia, the bush of New Zealand,
the forests of Canada, and the wilds of Africa
could only be examined with a microscope, the
remains of thousands of men would be discovered
who, having been bushed (<i>i.e.</i> lost in the forest),
have died of hunger, thirst or exhaustion, and whose
remains, unfound, have wasted away until only a
few mouldering bones, some tattered rags, and a
few fragments of rusty metal remain to tell the tale
and act as a warning to others. I have on two
occasions been the finder of the remains of men
who have been lost. One on the Taupo plains,
who disappeared and who, although he was missed
and looked for, was not found until three years
after his disappearance, when I, quite by chance,
stumbled on the poor chap&rsquo;s bones, which were
identified by a glass eye. The other case was the
bones of a white man I found while shooting in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
South Africa. Who or what he had been never transpired.
That he had been a white man was evident,
but when or how he had been lost I never found
out. I remember well that after I had searched
the vicinity for anything that could have been used
as a clue to his identity, I stood over the poor bones
and moralised. This poor chap must have belonged
to someone in the world who cared for him. Yet
here he lay nameless, and unknown, his bones to
be buried, as soon as my hunting boys with knife
and tomahawk could scoop out a hole, by a man
who was a perfect stranger to him, or, for all I
knew to the contrary, we might have been comrades
in two or three wars, or have hobnobbed together
scores of times. However, there, under a tree, his
bones lie, and I have no doubt that all marks of
his grave, even the cross I cut out on the tree, to
mark the spot, have long ago disappeared, and yet
it is quite possible to this day there are people
hoping and wondering if he will turn up. In the
colonies men disappear very rapidly, and they are
not readily missed. So they do in this great
wilderness, London, whose hidden mysteries far
and away outnumber all the frontier mysteries of
the British Empire put together, but yet somehow
the picture of a man lost in the bush, dying, alone,
of starvation, thirst and exhaustion seems, if not
so pathetic, at least more romantic than the scores
of hungry, ragged and homeless creatures who
wander about the Embankment, or the slums of the
mighty city. Very many times during my life on
the frontiers of the various colonies in which I
have served I have been called on to assist in the
search for a missing man; sometimes we have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
successful, and have found our man alive, sometimes
we have found him dead, and often we have
searched in vain, the poor chap having disappeared,
as if taken from earth in a chariot of fire. I could
fill a book with yarns of cases of people being lost
and found, and of being lost and not found, but the
most wonderful case I know of is that of a young
colonial, who was lost for forty days, yet was found
alive, and who I believe to be still living.</p>

<p>In 1891 I had taken command of the De Beer&rsquo;s
Company Expedition to Mashonaland, consisting
of sixty white men, forty colonial boys (natives),
and eighteen waggons. The above I was to conduct
from Kimberley to Salisbury, a trek of about 1300
miles. It was no joke. Very many of my men were
quite raw hands, and just after we had left Kimberley
the heaviest rains ever known in South Africa
came on, so that the rivers became flooded, the
swamps impassable, and the roads, such as they
were, so rotten that the heavily laden waggons
sank to their bed plates every few minutes.</p>

<p>However, I at last passed Tuli, and proceeded
some eighteen miles on the Umzinguani River,
where I determined to halt for a fortnight, so as
to rest and recuperate my worn-out oxen. In Tuli
the O.C. of the B.S.A. Police had told me that
some days before I reached that place a man had
been lost from some waggons that had been outspanned
at the Umzinguani River. Up to date he
had not been heard of, so he requested me to make
a careful search and try to discover any trace of
the missing man. I promised to do so, and asked
for all the particulars. The man was a Colonial
of Dutch descent, who was acting as orderly to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
some Dominican Nursing Sisters <i>en route</i> to Salisbury.
They had outspanned across the river, in
the early morning. After breakfast the man had
taken his rifle, had entered the bush on the down-river
side of the road, to try and shoot a buck for
fresh meat, but had never returned. The waggons
had waited three days for him, and then trekked on.
I also ascertained that some twelve miles farther on
the road was crossed by a big creek, that ran into
the river some miles below the drift. This being
the case, I failed to see how a colonial man, <i>provided
he kept his head</i>, could be lost, as the area in
which the occurrence happened was surrounded on
all sides by good landmarks. It was in fact an
irregular triangle, bounded on one side by the river,
on another by the creek, and on the third by the
road. Provided he struck the road, he had only to
turn to his left to reach the outspan. If he struck
the river he would only have to follow it up and
find his waggons, and if he came across the creek
he would only have to follow it to the road or river.
This seems easy enough; but, as an old and experienced
scout, I knew there were fifty sorts of
trouble that might have happened to him, or he
might have been guilty of a score of follies, all
inexcusable but all committed frequently, even by
old hands. He had gone away without his coat,
that we knew; he might also have gone without
matches&mdash;this was quite likely&mdash;and probably with
only two or three rounds of ammunition. It was a
very bad lion country: he might have tackled one
and got the worst of the encounter; he might have
been hurt by a wounded buck, sprained his ankle,
broken his leg or otherwise hurt himself. It is folly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
a man going shooting alone in a South African bush.
Anything may happen in a moment, and then a man
by himself is helpless and unable to send for assistance.
We reached the Umzinguani River at daylight,
crossed the drift and outspanned. After
breakfast I collected the men, explained my plans
to them and drew them a rough map of the area
over which our search was to be made. I selected
seventy men, black and white, for the job, and my plan
was to extend these men some ten or twelve yards
apart and, keeping our right on the river&rsquo;s bank, to
move down in line till we came to the spot where the
creek ran into the river. Then, if we found no trace
or spoor of him, to swing round and return to the
road, taking, of course, a new line parallel to, and
touching, the first one; and to enable us to do this
correctly I ordered the man on the left flank to
blaze the trees on his line, so that we should know
we were not going over the same ground twice, nor
leave a gap between the lines of search.</p>

<p>I had plenty of old hands among my men, both
black and white, and on reaching the junction of
the river and creek I was certain the work had
been done thoroughly, although nothing had been
found. At the junction I found a lot of Dutchmen,
some twenty in number, who were outspanned there.
They were trek riders, who, after delivering their
loads in Salisbury, had hauled off the road and
camped for the purpose of resting their oxen and
shooting big game to make biltong. They had
heard nothing of the lost man, but insisted on
helping me to look for him. That afternoon we
searched the new line of country back to the road,
the right-hand man blazing the trees <i>en route</i>, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
found nothing except game and lion spoor. The
next day we started from where we had left off and
took a new line, the left-hand man blazing the trees,
while the right-flank man worked down the line of
the previous afternoon. I did not rush the men, as
I had no hopes of finding the poor fellow alive, but
yet I hoped to find his rifle&mdash;a lion could not eat
that&mdash;or some trace of him, so I told the men to
search carefully and not hurry. I had two bugles
with me, and the men shouting to one another, so
as to keep in touch, made plenty of noise, that the
poor chap must have heard if alive. The bush was
an open one, with little undergrowth, so we had a
good chance of finding anything out of the common.</p>

<p>We kept up this search ten days, until I was
convinced every bit of ground in the triangle had
been prospected; but we found absolutely nothing.
Then we said good-bye to the Dutchmen and continued
our journey. Some weeks afterwards a post
cart passed me going to Salisbury and the corporal
in charge of it told me a wonderful tale. The Dutchmen
had remained at their camp some time after
my departure, and the day before they moved off one
of them, while out shooting, had found a white man
concealed in an ant-bear hole. He was stark naked,
and in a dreadfully emaciated condition, the nails
torn off his hands and his teeth actually worn down
to his gums. He was quite mad, but the Dutchman
carried him to his waggon, and trekked into
Tuli; where he was taken into the hospital, and with
careful nursing restored to reason and health.</p>

<p>He afterwards came up to Salisbury, where I
was staff officer. I knew him well, and held frequent
conversations with him regarding his woeful experi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>ences.
His story is a very short one. He had
left the waggons after breakfast for a stroll, with his
rifle, three cartridges and no matches. All at once
it dawned on him he was lost, so he started running
(<i>a fatal mistake</i>), and remembers no more. Up
to the time he was found, quite close to the Dutchman&rsquo;s
camp, over forty days had elapsed. How he
had lived he had no idea. The state of his hands
and teeth showed he must have grubbed roots and
gnawed them; but he must have obtained water
from either the creek or river, and, mad as he was,
one of them should have guided him to safety.</p>

<p>Again, how did he escape my search and that
of other parties who had looked for him? What
became of his rifle, boots and clothes? And, above
all, why did not a lion skoff him? To these and
heaps of other queries I can only say that truth
is stranger than fiction, that I have told the yarn
as it happened, and can&rsquo;t answer conundrums. In
the above yarn I have told you that the lost man
began to run, and have noted it was a fatal mistake.
Yes, it is a fatal mistake to begin to run when you
discover you are lost, for I can assure you that it
is not a difficult matter for even an old and experienced
scout to lose himself, if he lets his mind and
attention wander. But now I will spin you a yarn
about one of my men who was lost on the same
trek to Mashonaland.</p>

<p>This man was a fine, strapping fellow about
thirty years of age. He was a well-educated
mechanic, a good athlete and football-player, but
a new chum in the bush and at frontier work.
We were at the time trekking along the Limpopo
River, a very bad bit of country indeed, and I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
had given my men warning not to leave the
waggons.</p>

</div>

<p>I had also tried to teach the new chums some
simple facts in bushcraft. The country here
swarmed with feathered game: partridges, pheasants,
and guinea-fowls. It was my custom to walk on
before the train of waggons, on the trek, with my
gun, and shoot plenty of these birds sunning themselves
on the road. One evening when the men
were inspanning, a very noisy job when you have
eighteen waggons, I took my gun and strolled
along as usual. The road was about thirty yards
broad, and well-defined, the wide river running
some one hundred yards on the right-hand side of it.
I had progressed about two hundred yards from
the outspan, but was still well within earshot and
sight of it, when I saw the man I have mentioned
come rushing through the trees and thorn bushes,
down the slope on the left-hand side of the road.
At first I thought he had gone mad, and so, for
a time, he was. He had lost his hat, his khaki
clothes were torn to rags, his face worked convulsively,
with his eyes bulging out of his head,
while the perspiration ran down him in streams.
He reached the road within a yard or two
of me; but he neither saw me, the road, nor the
river in front of him. I jumped forward and
seized him, saying: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?
What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He struggled for a moment, as if to try and
break away; then some expression came into
his face, and he gasped out: &ldquo;Oh, thank God,
major, you have found me. I knew you would
look for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Look for you?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s gone
wrong with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir,&rdquo; he cried&mdash;and, strong man as he was,
he shook with fear&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m lost in the bush.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lost in the bush?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;What do you
mean? Don&rsquo;t you see you are on the road? Don&rsquo;t
you see the waggons? Don&rsquo;t you hear the row the
boys are making inspanning, or see the river in
front of you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do now, sir; but I saw nothing, and heard
nothing, when you caught hold of me. Oh, thank
God you found me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he was quite unnerved, I took him back to
my waggon, and gave him a tot, at the same time
making inquiries as to the time he had left the
camp; and I found out he had not been absent more
than an hour. So much for the rapidity with which
bush fear unnerves a new chum, no matter how
strong he is, unless he has the will-power to fight
against it. On questioning this man, subsequently,
he told me he had only strolled into the bush for a
few minutes, then tried to find the waggons, had
failed to do so, started running, and remembered
no more. Fortunately he had run in a circle that
crossed the road; had he circled in the other
direction, nothing could have saved him, and
another case of the bush having claimed a white
man&rsquo;s life would have been registered. Now anyone
would think that one experience of that sort
would have been enough for that man, but it was
not, for, some time afterwards, he again went off
by himself, and again got lost. At this time we
were trekking through very rough country, full of
steep, high granite kopjes, and, notwithstanding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
my strict orders to the contrary, he left the
waggons, and went into the bush alone. On his
absence that night being reported to me, I took a
party of colonial blacks with a couple of Mashonas
and ascended a big kopje, at the foot of which we
were outspanned, and from that height examined
the country. It was not long before I spotted
a fire, about two miles away, that was evidently a
white man&rsquo;s fire; so I at once had an answering
fire lit, and carefully took the bearings of the one
I saw.</p>

<p>At daybreak I sent a party of men, under an
experienced old hand, to bring in the straggler.
They reached the place and found the remains of
the fire, but he had gone. Not content with his
first folly, the stupid fellow had evidently tried to
find his way back to us, and lost himself again.
For two days we looked for him, and on the third
the late Mr Alfred Beit, who was travelling up to
Mashonaland, brought him into my camp, having
come across him, in a dazed condition, quite by
chance, some miles back on the road. You may
depend that the reception he got from me was a
very warm one, and that I took most effectual precautions
to prevent him leaving the waggons again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>THE NON-COM.&rsquo;S REVENGE, OR THE CURATE AND THE
SNAKE</small></h2>


<p>I was proceeding up-country in South Africa with
a small party of troopers and led horses. The day
before I was to start the bishop came to me and
said: &ldquo;One of my young men has to go up to
headquarters. Do you mind taking him with you?
He is quite new to the country and, as he is not
well off, he can&rsquo;t afford the heavy coach fare. You
are taking up led horses. He tells me he can ride
a little, and you would be doing a very great kindness
if you would take him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now the bishop and myself were rather pals in our
way; for although, as a rule, I did not trouble the
Church much, yet I have always had the greatest
respect for the cloth, and perhaps, as this youngster
might be a varsity or public school man, he would be
company for me on my 500-mile ride. So I said: &ldquo;All
right, bishop; trot him round to the lines to-morrow
morning with his traps, an hour before sunrise,
and he will find us ready to start. Remember, it
is a hard ride, roads bad, rivers full, horses only
half broken, and warn him to be punctual.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Next morning the two light mule waggons that
were to accompany us were inspanned and ready
to load, the horses saddled, early coffee drank, but
no curate. Now this was bad. Nothing ever goes
quite right the first trek. Mules are new to their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
places in the span; men, with their last night&rsquo;s
heads on them, are sulky; the officer a bit sharp,
so as to knock them into shape; the half-broken
horses restive; while the non-com. in charge of the
waggons is anxious to pack them, and can&rsquo;t do so,
to his satisfaction, until he has all the baggage to
his hand. Consequently the curate, or, as the men
profanely termed him, the bally sky-pilot, not
having turned up to time, he was being growled
at and cursed. At last he came, his kit consisting
of paper bags, parcels and band-boxes.</p>

<p>How he ever expected them to stand the rough
usage of the road the Lord only knows. Then he
paraded in a field kit composed of a long black
coat, short black trousers, low shoes and white
socks. Such a get-up to ride 500 miles in I had
never seen, and my men eyed him with wonder and
astonishment. He came up to me and introduced
himself, though he evidently did not think it worth
while to apologise for keeping us waiting, but
trusted we were going to have fine weather, that
he would have a quiet horse, that the men did
not swear, that we should meet no wild animals,
above all, snakes. In fact he was so full of trust
that I had to cut him short, and when he suggested
the advisability of saying a few prayers before we
started on this very dangerous journey I told him
sharply to get on his horse, as smart as he could,
and then he could pray there as long as he liked.</p>

<p>This was not perhaps quite polite; but no officer
likes to be kept waiting when he is on the point
of starting on a journey, and, as I said before,
tempers are crisp for the first trek. I had selected
for him a quiet old troop horse; and it was well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
I had done so, as when he started to mount he
tumbled over on the other side, and when at last
we got him into his saddle he gave endless trouble:
first of all his stirrup leathers were too long, then
too short, and he was such a noodle, unable to do
anything for himself, that a man had to keep on
dismounting every few minutes to render him
assistance.</p>

<p>Now there is no class of men in the world more
respectful to clergy, of any denomination, than
the up-country man, be he miner, farmer or trooper.
A parson or priest is always made welcome at any
camp he may choose to call at, and the best in
that camp is placed at his disposal. The men,
no matter how wild and godless, will listen to him
with attention, so long as the time is fit and the
homily straight; but the minister must have tact.</p>

<p>It is by no means wise for a pastor to preach a
sermon against bad language when the waggon is
stuck in a drift, or when the cook&rsquo;s mate upsets the
bucket of tea into the fire; no, it is better for him,
under these circumstances, to bide his time, close
his ears, retire a short distance and commune with
himself.</p>

<p>Now this Johnny had not the tact of an ostrich.
He had already made a bad impression on us by
being late, his wonderful get-up, and by his utter
helplessness. This would have been looked over,
and the men, thoroughly good-natured, would have
done their best for him, and have taken all the care
in the world of him, provided he would have left
their souls alone, at least during the trek. Leading
unbroken horses, for the first day or two, is no joke.
They try to break away, and sometimes do so,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
when they at once head back for their old feed-grounds,
have to be rounded-up and recaught;
and it does not improve men&rsquo;s tempers when this
occurs, and they drop a big D, to have a useless
new chum, who, sitting like a monkey on his horse,
with his trousers rucked up to his knees, raises his
hands and says: &ldquo;Oh, my dear, dear man, where
do you expect to go if you use such horrid
language? Oh, how can you say that? Please
don&rsquo;t be so profane,&rdquo; etc., etc.</p>

<p>Likewise at the first drift, a very bad one, with
a rotten bottom, a very steep pull-out, mules
jibbing and waggons sticking, it is not pleasant
to have an ignorant josser interfering and making
himself more objectionable every minute, by praying
out loud that evil should not happen to him
for being in the company of such godless men.
This he did, and before we reached the first outspan
he had made himself decidedly unpopular; and he
did not improve matters there.</p>

<p>I have always made it a rule, when I am trekking
with a small party, to take my food in company
and at the same camp fire with the men, who will
never take a liberty with an officer doing this&mdash;it
draws the feeling of comradeship tighter, and also
only one man is required to do the cooking. Now
the new chum objected to this, and that in an
audible voice. He informed me he did not care to
sit at the same fire as troopers, most of whom were
low fellows. By the same token, most of them
were gentlemen by birth, while some of them were
varsity and public school men to boot, and all of
them thorough good fellows. I lost my temper
with the ass, and told him he could light a fire for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
himself, or, if he preferred it, could sit with the
Kafirs, but if he required food he had better come
and have it. This he did with a very bad grace, and
noticing the old waggon non-com. (a strict Roman
Catholic) cross himself before beginning his food,
had the worse taste to attack the old fellow&rsquo;s
religion and preach at him for his bad language
at the drift.</p>

<p>The grizzled old warrior said nothing, but I could
see a grin come over his face that I knew predicted
danger to the new chum; and presently he began to
talk about snakes and lions.</p>

<p>The curate opened his ears wide, taking in all
that was said, and by the time we were ready to
inspan for the evening trek he had become very
nervous.</p>

<p>That afternoon he rode with two or three of the
troopers, who filled him up to the chin with wonderful
and awful yarns about snake bites and lion stories;
so that when we halted for the night he dare not
move out of the light thrown by the camp fire.</p>

<p>He did not object to sharing the evening meal with
the men, but again made himself very offensive to the
non-com., and, on the latter serving out the evening
ration of rum, made most uncalled-for remarks, and
preached us a sermon on temperance, and the evils
of strong drink.</p>

<p>Well, the ration was drunk, the last pipe
smoked, the sentry posted and the blankets laid
down. Again he started to fuss. Where was he to
sleep? He had never slept out in the open before.
He could not sleep without undressing. Was there
not great danger from wild animals and snakes?
And he had no blankets in his kit to begin with.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<p>The old non-com. looked after him like a mother,
the men gave up blankets for his use, and at last
all turned in; but as I fell off to sleep I saw the
non-com. go to a thorn-tree and select, with much
care, a branch. The new chum had undressed,
said most voluminous prayers and, tired out by the
journey, fallen asleep.</p>

<p>Everything was quite quiet, when suddenly we
were all roused by the most piercing yells. A
frontier man is awake and on the alert in a
moment, and I at once demanded what the row
was about.</p>

<p>The parson, nearly mad with terror, screamed
out he had been bitten by a serpent and must die;
he also held out to me his naked arm, on which
I saw two small punctures with drops of blood
oozing out of them.</p>

<p>To tie a piece of rhimpie round his arm above
the wound, and twist it tight with a cleaning rod,
jab a penknife into the punctures, and suck them,
at the same time ordering the patient to hold his
bally row, and the non-com. to bring a pannikin of
rum, did not take long, and I at once administered
a tot that would have made an old bos&rsquo;n cough and
splutter. Then I had him walked about and in
a few minutes gave him another quartermaster&rsquo;s
nip, which got well home on him, and he became
very drunk indeed. Of course as soon as I saw
him drunk I knew he was safe, and told him to
stop whimpering, get into his blankets and go to
sleep. He did certainly stop whimpering, but he
refused to go to bed, or go to sleep. No, he
declared he would not go home till morning. His
holiness sloughed off him like a serpent&rsquo;s skin, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
in a few minutes, to the huge delight of my godless
troopers, he began to tell very naughty stories and
to sing very ribald songs. He likewise, in his
nightgown (a garment never before seen in that
part of the world), began to show us some can-can
steps, and at last behaved in such a manner that I
was forced to tell him I would have him pegged out
and gagged if he did not hold his row.</p>

<p>On this he consigned us all to the place it was
his duty to guide us away from, got into bed, burst
into tears, and sobbed himself to sleep.</p>

<p>I saw by the chuckling of the men, and the unholy
grin of the non-com., some joke had been perpetrated;
but as I could see I was not to be informed
of it I gave the order &ldquo;Lights out,&rdquo; turned over
and went to sleep.</p>

<p>Next morning, an hour before daybreak, the rouse
went, blankets were bundled up, horses were
quickly rubbed over, saddled, and while they were
eating their half-ration of mealies the waggons
were packed and early coffee served out. But oh! the
wretched new chum! He was stiff from the ride of
the previous day, yet, sore as his body was from the
unaccustomed saddle, his head was much worse.
He groaned when he was roused up and told to
turn out. Could he not be allowed to sleep longer?
What had happened? Was there no soda water?
Oh dear, oh dear. The non-com. proffered a
pannikin of hot coffee and recommended a tot
in it. The curate took the coffee but refused
the tot, although the non-com. swore it was
the best medicine in the world for anyone
who had been on the bust the night before,
and assured the poor wretch that he himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
always doctored himself with one, after he had
had a wet night. Anyhow he must get up, as the
waggons had to be packed, and we should move off
the moment the horses and mules had finished their
feed. He could not or would not, so I was called,
and went to him. I saw in a moment the miserable
wretch was unable to ride, so ordered the non-com.
to make a place for him on one of the waggons,
which was done, and, making him dress, we put him
on to it. At the midday halt he was better, and
at the night outspan he was so well that he began
to get aggressive again. The men stood it for a
bit, and then one of them repeated one of his own
stories, and another started to sing one of his songs.
He rushed to me and complained; but I pointed out
to him that the song and story were his own, which
he had favoured us with the night before, and therefore
he could not grumble.</p>

<p>This sort of thing went on all night, and when
the rum ration was served out, and he indignantly
refused to share it, he was politely requested to
favour the men with a discourse on the evils of
drink, and bad company.</p>

<p>Of course the men treated him with the greatest
respect in my presence, but when they could get
him alone he caught it, and even at the camp fire
sly shots were fired at him, such as low fellows,
get drunk, shocking language, filthy songs, etc., etc.,
until the poor wretch was nearly driven mad with
shame and contrition, and hung on to me so much
that he became a perfect nuisance.</p>

<p>This went on for a couple of days, when at a wayside
house where the mail coach stopped I had become
so sick of him, and also, I must confess, sorry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
for him, that I paid his coach fare and persuaded
him to continue his journey by it, an offer he thankfully
accepted. And so I got rid of him, with equal
pleasure.</p>

<p>It was after he had left us I was let into the joke
that had so amused the men on the night of the
catastrophe.</p>

<p>The old non-com., incensed by the new chum&rsquo;s
tactless interference with his mules, his language
and his religion, and knowing full well the course I
should pursue in counteracting a case of snake bite,
had taken advantage of the camp being asleep to
jam into his victim&rsquo;s arm the thorns I had seen
him go to the tree to get, and then on the alarm
being given had declared he had seen a snake, so
in this crafty way had gained his revenge.</p>

<p>The new chum proved no good up-country,
and in a few months was sent back to England,
where it is to be hoped he has found a better
sphere for his talents than in trying to convert
members of the Lost Legion.</p>

<p>And now this skein is ended it is the profound
hope of an old Lost Legionary that the perusal of
them has not bored you, and he only wishes he had
been in better form to do justice to the kind support
he has received from the Press and public.</p>

<p><i>Glasgow Herald</i>, <i>11th July 1912</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;The book is to be commended
for its real interest and exciting narrative, combined
with humour and plain-speaking.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Dublin Times</i>, <i>9th August 1912</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;To those who wish to know
something of the life of a soldier and the kind of fighting that
was done in those early days for the aggrandisement of the
Empire, we can give no better advice than to procure this book.
It is full of candid criticism and genuine information.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>The Graphic</i>, <i>27th July 1912</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;A Lost Legionary in South
Africa,&rsquo; by Colonel G. Hamilton-Browne, known as Maori
Browne, contains some excellent stories.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Review of Reviews</i>, <i>July 1912</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;A book with the right ring;
mainly concerned with fighting. The author preaches with
rough and ready eloquence an impromptu sermon which will
amuse, arrest and convince.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Belfast News Letter</i>, <i>29th August 1912</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;The book is written
in the same attractive style as its predecessor, and there are
many striking passages in it.&rdquo;</p>
